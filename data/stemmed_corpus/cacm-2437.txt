gener perform analysi of kei to address transform method us an abstract file concept thi paper present a new approach to the analysi of perform of the variou kei to address transform method in thi approach the kei in a file ar assum to have been select from the kei space accord to a certain probabilist select algorithm all file with the same number of kei select from thi kei space will be suitabl weight in accord with the algorithm and the averag perform of the transform method on these file will be us as the potenti of these method us thi analysi method with the same overal perform can be classifi and kei distribut partial to certain transform can be identifi all thi can be done analyt the approach is appli to a group of transform method us file whose kei ar select randomli cacm octob 1973 lum v y hash hash techniqu hash method hash code kei transform kei to address transform direct address random random access scatter storag inform retriev hash analysi random perform analysi 3 7 3 72 3 73 3 74 3 79 4 9 5 9 ca731003 jb januari 20 1978 11 51 am
