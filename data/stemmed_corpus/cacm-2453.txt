inform theori appli to the convers of decis tabl to comput program us idea from inform theori thi paper develop a heurist algorithm that convert a limit entri decis tabl to a tree structur comput program with near minimum averag process time the method is applic to ani limit entri decis tabl and doe not requir that action have singl rule or that the cost of test condit be equal it is thu more gener than the previous publish heurist algorithm compar to the optim algorithm of reinwald and soland thi algorithm is easi to code and take a much smaller translat time it is thu felt that it is more us in practic the algorithm is well suit for manual convers of decis tabl to flowchart cacm septemb 1973 ganapathi s rajaraman v decis tabl optimum comput program inform measur 3 50 4 12 5 6 ca730902 jb januari 23 1978 10 01 am
