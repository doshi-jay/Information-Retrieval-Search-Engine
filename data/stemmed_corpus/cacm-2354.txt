implement clenshaw curti quadratur ii comput the cosin transform in a companion paper to thi i methodolog and experi the automat clenshaw curti quadratur scheme wa describ and how each quadratur formula us in the scheme requir a cosin transform of the integrand valu wa shown the high cost of these cosin transform ha been a seriou drawback in us clenshaw curti quadratur two other problem relat to the cosin transform have also been troubl some first the convent comput of the cosin transform by recurr relat is numer unstabl particularli at the low frequenc which have the largest effect upon the integr second in case the automat scheme should requir refin of the sampl storag is requir to save the integrand valu after the cosin transform is comput thi second part of the paper show how the cosin transform can be comput by a modif of the fast fourier transform and all three problem overcom the modif is also applic in other circumst requir cosin or sine transform such as polynomi interpol through the chebyshev point cacm mai 1972 gentleman w m fast fourier transform cosin transform clenshaw curti quadratur chebyshev seri 5 13 5 14 5 16 ca720506 jb januari 31 1978 9 56 am
