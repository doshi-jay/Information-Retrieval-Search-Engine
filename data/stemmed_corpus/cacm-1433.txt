a note on linear program algorithm design a combinatori problem as linear program model grow bigger and bigger in size much actual data that must be memor is often put on magnet tape or disk and consequ there is an improportion fast rise in the consumpt of comput timeo cut down thi expens an ever increas effort is made to design more effici algorithm thi paper is meant to support the effort it is attempt to find some characterist of the wai a pivot column is found the number of repetit of a certain transfer of data from tape to core memori is consid after some simplif the problem is restat in a gener wai the gener function of the probabl distribut and the moment gener function of the number of repetit is found asymptot formula ar given for the moment us a result from a paper of s narumi 1 the result mai be appli to write veri effici routin that search for an extrem valu in a tabl formula provid a mean of calcul the comput time in thi case cacm mai 1966 roe p b m ca660504 jb march 3 1978 10 10 am
