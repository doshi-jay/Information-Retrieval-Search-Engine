multi tape and infinit state automata a survei a survei of machin which ar more power than finit automata and less power than gener ture machin is present it is felt that the machin in thi categori ar as close relat to digit comput as either the finit automata or the unrestrict ture machin intermedi machin can be creat by adjoin on infinit state memori to a finit state machin and then perform ani or all of the follow 1 restrict the manner in which the unbound portion of the memori can be access 2 bound the number of step allow for a comput by some increas recurs function of the length of the input 3 restrict the total amount of memori avail in the same manner exampl from all three class and their properti ar discuss cacm decemb 1965 fischer p c ca651215 jb march 6 1978 3 24 pm
