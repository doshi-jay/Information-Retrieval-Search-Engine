effici implement of a variabl project algorithm for nonlinear least squar problem nonlinear least squar frequent aris for which the variabl to be solv for can be separ into a linear and a nonlinear part a variabl project algorithm ha been develop recent which is design to take advantag of the structur of a problem whose variabl separ in thi wai thi paper give a slightli more effici and slightli more gener version of thi algorithm than ha appear earlier cacm march 1974 krogh f t nonlinear least squar paramet estim variabl project 5 14 5 15 ca740313 jb januari 18 1978 10 49 am
