a highli parallel algorithm for approxim all zero of a polynomi with onli real zero an algorithm is describ base on newton s method which simultan approxim all zero of a polynomi with onli real zero the algorithm which is conceptu suitabl for parallel comput determin it own start valu so that converg to the zero is guarante multipl zero and their multipl ar readili determin at no point in the method is polynomi deflat us cacm novemb 1972 patrick m l parallel numer algorithm real polynomi real zero newton s method start valu guarante converg 5 15 ca721103 jb januari 27 1978 2 35 pm
