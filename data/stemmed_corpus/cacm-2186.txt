numer properti of the ritz trefftz algorithm for optim control in thi paper the ritz trefftz algorithm is appli to the comput solut of the state regul problem the algorithm repres a modif of the ritz direct method and is design to improv the speed of solut and the storag requir to the point where real time implement becom feasibl the modif is shown to be more stabl computation than the tradit ritz approach the first concern of the paper is to describ the algorithm and establish it properti as a valid and us numer techniqu in particular such us properti as definit and reason of condit ar establish for the method the second part of the paper is devot to a comparison of the new techniqu with the standard procedur of numer integr a matrix riccati equat to determin a feedback matrix the new techniqu is shown to be significantli faster for compar accuraci cacm june 1971 bosarg jr w e johnson o g spline regul problem control theori numer analysi 5 1 ca710604 jb februari 3 1978 10 12 am
