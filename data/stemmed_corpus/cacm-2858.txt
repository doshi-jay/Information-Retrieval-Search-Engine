a process for the determin of address in variabl length address an algorithm is present for the assign of instruct address and format under the follow condit 1 the length of the instruct vari as a function of the distanc of the instruct from it target 2 there exist an optim criterion which impli some preferenti choic subject to the address constraint thi mai be for exampl achiev the smallest number of long instruct in which case the total code length is minim or minim the assign address of a specifi point in the program the algorithm is suitabl for arbitrari program structur and a choic of optim criteria cacm june 1976 frieder g saal h j variabl length address assembl page 4 11 4 12 ca760604 jb januari 4 1978 2 09 pm
