the augment predict analyz for context free languag it rel effici it ha been proven by greibach that for a given context free grammar g a standard form grammar gs can be construct which gener the same languag as is gener by g and whose rule ar all of the form z cy 1 y m m o where z and y i ar intermedi symbol and c a termin symbol sinc the predict analyz at harvard us a standard form grammar it can accept the languag of ani context free grammar g given an equival standard form grammar gs the structur descript sd gs x assign to a given sentenc x by the predict analyz howev ar usual differ from the structur descript sd g x assign to the same sentenc by the origin context free grammar g from which gs is deriv in section 1 an algorithm origin due to abbott is describ standard form grammar each of whose rule is in standard form supplement by addit inform describ it deriv from the origin context free grammar a techniqu for perform the sd gs x to sd g x transform effect is also describ in section 2 the augment predict analyz as a pars algorithm for arbitrari context free languag is compar with two other pars algorithm a select top to bottom algorithm similar to iron error correct pars algorithm and an immedi constitu analyz which is an extens of sakai cock s algorithm for normal grammar the comparison is base upon sever criteria of effici cover core storag requir complex of the program and process time cacm novemb 1966 kuno s ca661108 jb march 2 1978 3 11 pm
