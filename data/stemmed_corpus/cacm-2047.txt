incorpor origin shift into the qr algorithm for symmetr tridiagon matric the qr iter for the eigenvalu of a symmetr tridiagon matrix can be acceler by incorpor a sequenc of origin shift the origin shift mai be either subtract directli from the diagon element of the matrix or incorpor by mean of an implicit algorithm both method have drawback the direct method can unnecessarili degrad small eigenvalu while the implicit method can effect loos the shift and therebi retard the converg thi paper present a new method which ha neither drawback cacm june 1970 stewart g w eigenvalu eigenvector qr method origin shift symmetr tridiagon matrix 5 14 ca700608 jb februari 13 1978 11 02 am
