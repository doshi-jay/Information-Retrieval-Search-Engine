on quadrat adapt rout algorithm two analyt model of a store and forward commun network ar construct on to find the optim messag rout and the other to illustr the equilibrium stationari state maintain by an adapt rout algorithm these model show that adapt rout doe not satisfi the necessari condit for an optim rout adapt rout tend to overus the direct path and underus altern rout becaus it doe not consid the impact of it current rout decis on the futur state of the network the form of the optim condit suggest that a modif of the adapt algorithm will result in optim the modif requir the substitut of a quadrat bia term instead of a linear on in the rout tabl maintain at each network node simul result ar present which confirm the theoret analysi for a simpl network cacm januari 1976 agnew c e rout algorithm adapt rout quadrat rout altern rout store and forward network distribut network comput network messag switch 3 81 8 0 8 1 8 3 ca760103 jb januari 5 1978 10 37 am
