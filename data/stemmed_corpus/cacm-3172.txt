an algorithm for plan collis free path among polyhedr obstacl thi paper describ a collis avoid algorithm for plan a safe path for a polyhedr object move among known polyhedr object the algorithm transform the obstacl so that thei repres the locu of forbidden posit for an arbitrari refer point on the move object a trajectori of thi refer point which avoid all forbidden region is free of collis trajectori ar found by search a network which indic for each vertex in the transform obstacl which other vertic can be reach safe cacm octob 1979 lozano perez t weslei m path find collis free path polyhedr object polyhedr obstacl graph search grow object 3 15 3 64 3 66 8 1 ca791005 db januari 17 1980 10 13 am
