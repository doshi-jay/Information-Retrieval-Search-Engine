an exponenti method for the solut of system of ordinari differenti equat an explicit coupl singl step method for the numer solut of initi valu problem for system of ordinari differenti equat is present the method wa design to be gener purpos in natur but to be especi effici when deal with stiff system of differenti equat it is in gener second order except for the case of a linear system with constant coeffici and linear forc term in that case the method is third order it ha been implement and put to routin usag in biolog applic where stiff frequent appear with favor result when compar to a standard fourth order rung kutta implement comput time requir by thi method ha rang from compar for certain nonstiff problem to better than two order of magnitud faster for some highli stiff system cacm decemb 1974 chu s c berman m numer solut ordinari differenti equat initi valu problem stiff system 5 17 ca741207 jb januari 13 1978 4 20 pm
