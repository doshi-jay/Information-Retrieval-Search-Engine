a unifi comput method for the analysi of complet factori experi a comput method which mai be us for the calcul of sum of squar in the analysi of varianc of complet factori experi and in the comput of main effect or interact mean is describ the method is elucid as unifi sinc on method can be us for a varieti of purpos each previous requir differ method the program advantag of such a method ar obviou the follow variant ar discuss 1 the standard analysi of varianc 2 analys omit certain level of on or more factor 3 separ analys for some level of a factor or for combin of level of more than on factor these ar perform simultan 4 the calcul of main effect or interact mean the mean expect the data in standard order and it leav the data in that order so that mani analys of the same data can be perform without rearrang the total sum of squar exclud a replic sum of squar is partit into all polynomi partit and their interact each with on degre of freedom thi is so even if factor have unequ space factor level cacm januari 1967 cooper b e ca670105 jb februari 28 1978 4 49 pm
