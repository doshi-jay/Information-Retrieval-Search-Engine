on the optim of perform of time share system by simul a simul model of a time share system with a finit noncontigu store and an infinit auxiliari store is us to studi the variat of system paramet such as store size number of job allow to execut simultan job schedul algorithm etc the effect of these variat on a measur of system perform is us to ascertain which of the paramet control by the job schedul algorithm includ the schedul itself requir optim and which of the paramet not normal control by the schedul algorithm have a mark effect on system perform system perform is base upon the mean cost of delai to all job process it is shown that signific improv in the measur of system perform can be obtain by us variabl time slice techniqu and by select the optimum round robin cycl time it appear that these featur would benefit from optim wherea other paramet control by the schedul algorithm affect system perform in a predict manner and would not benefit from optim featur not normal under the control of the schedul algorithm can also have a mark effect on the measur of perform in particular supervisor overhead the size of the store and the speed of the cpu a comparison is made between the result of the simul model and two analyt equat for quantum orient nonpreempt time share system the comparison is found to be veri favor cacm june 1972 blatni j clark s r rourk t a time share simul studi optim measur of perform schedul algorithm 3 80 4 30 4 32 ca720601 jb januari 31 1978 9 19 am
