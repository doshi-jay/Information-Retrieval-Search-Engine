on the applic of the process of equal of maxima to obtain ration approxim to certain modifi bessel function the second reme algorithm as origin establish for polynomi mai converg or not when the approxim function ar ration howev the few result known in thi domain show how effici the algorithm can be to obtain approxim with a small error much more than in the polynomi case in which the best approxim can be veri nearli approach directli by a seri develop the aim of thi paper is to investig the limit of the applic of certain extens of the algorithm to the case where the approxim ar ration as well as to present some numer result cacm decemb 1966 gargantini l ca661204 jb march 2 1978 2 39 pm
