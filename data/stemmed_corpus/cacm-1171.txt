a comparison of the primal simplex and primal dual algorithm for linear program a statist comparison of the primal dual and the more commonli us primal simplex algorithm for solv linear program problem ha been made under the assumpt of start with a full artifici basi under these condit the primal dual method show a statist signific superior on randomli gener problem it ha also been found via a regress analysi that the relev paramet in determin the differ in the number of iter between the algorithm is not onli the number of constraint and the number of variabl but also the ratio of the latter to the former cacm novemb 1965 mueller r k cooper l ca651110 jb march 6 1978 4 50 pm
