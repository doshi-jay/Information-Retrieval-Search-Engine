grow applic of linear program us of linear program model ha grown so extens in recent year that the whole concept for organ a comput code ha undergon a radic chang it no longer is adequ mere to reduc a mathemat algorithm i e the simplex method to a comput code an advanc code must cope with such a varieti of situat that the respect comput subprogram must be organ into an integr system emphasi in thi paper is devot to the underli principl upon which futur linear program system must be base these viewpoint ar influenc by the new demand that applic within the petroleum industri ar place on such system some of the compon of such a system ar translat of problem statement in term of basic data to linear program matrix coeffici data transmiss for direct comput entri data file at the comput center data process and edit prior to solv the simplex algorithm an effici and reliabl code for solv the abov mention algorithm and flexibl mean for summar the result cacm june 1964 aronofski j s ca640601 jb march 9 1978 9 55 pm
