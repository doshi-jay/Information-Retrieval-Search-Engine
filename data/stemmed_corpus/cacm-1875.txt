polynomi and spline approxim by quadrat program the problem of approxim to a given function or of fit a given set of data where the approxim function is requir to have certain of it deriv of specifi sign over the whole rang of approxim is studi two approach ar present in each of which quadrat program is us to provid both the constraint on the deriv and the select of the function which yield the best fit the first is a modifi bernstein polynomi scheme and the second is a spline fit cacm juli 1969 amo d e slater m l constant sign deriv bernstein polynomi linear concav constraint quadrat program spline 5 13 5 41 ca690705 jb februari 17 1978 9 22 am
