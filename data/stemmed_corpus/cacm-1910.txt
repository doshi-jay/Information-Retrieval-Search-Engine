an algorithm for solv a special class of tridiagon system of linear equat an algorithm is present for solv a system of linear equat bu k where b is tridiagon and of a special form it is shown that thi algorithm is almost twice as fast as the gaussian elimin method usual suggest for solv such system in addit explicit formula for the invers and determin of the matrix b ar given cacm april 1969 rose d j tridiagon gaussian elimin central differ 5 14 5 17 ca690407 jb februari 17 1978 4 18 pm
