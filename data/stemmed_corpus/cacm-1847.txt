an algorithm for find a fundament set of cycl of a graph a fast method is present for find a fundament set of cycl for an undirect finit graph a span tree is grown and the vertic examin in turn unexamin vertic be store in a pushdown list to await examin on stage in the process is to take the top element v of the pushdown list and examin it i e inspect all those edg v z of the graph for which z ha not yet been examin if z is alreadi in the tree a fundament cycl is ad if not the edg v z is place in the tree there is exactli on such stage for each of the n vertic of the graph for larg n the store requir in creas as n 2 and the time as n g where g depend on the type of graph involv g is bound below by 2 and abov by 3 and it is shown that both bound ar attain in term of storag our algorithm is similar to that of gotlieb and corneil and superior to that of welch in term of speed it is similar to that of welch and superior to that of gotlieb and corneil testsshow our algorithm to be remark effici g 2 on random graph cacm septemb 1969 paton k fundament cycl set graph algorithm cycl span tree 5 32 ca690909 jb februari 15 1978 4 29 pm
