cover edg by cliqu with regard to keyword conflict and intersect graph kellerman ha present a method for determin keyword conflict and describ a heurist algorithm which solv a certain combinatori optim problem in connect with thi method thi optim problem is here shown to be equival to the problem of cover the edg of a graph by complet subgraph with the object of minim the number of complet subgraph a relationship between thi edg cliqu cover problem and the graph color problem is establish which allow algorithm for either on of these problem to be construct from algorithm for the other as consequ of thi relationship the keyword conflict problem and the edg cliqu cover problem ar shown to be np complet and if p np then thei do not admit polynomi time approxim algorithm which alwai produc solut within a factor less than 2 from the optimum cacm februari 1978 kou l stockmey l wong c watson t keyword conflict intersect graph node cliqu cover edg cliqu cover comput complex np complet problem polynomi time heurist 4 12 5 25 5 32 ca780205 jb march 28 1978 4 18 pm
