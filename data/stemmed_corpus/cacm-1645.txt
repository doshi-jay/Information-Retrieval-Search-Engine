a note on comput approxim to the exponenti function two method ar discuss which result in near minimax ration approxim to the exponenti function and at the same time retain the desir properti that the approxim for neg valu of the argument is the reciproc of the approxim for correspond posit valu these method lead to approxim which ar much superior to the commonli us converg of the gaussian continu fraction for the exponenti coeffici and error ar given for the interv 5 ln 2 5 ln 2 and ln 2 ln 2 cacm januari 1967 codi w j ralston a ca670110jb februari 28 1978 4 25 pm
