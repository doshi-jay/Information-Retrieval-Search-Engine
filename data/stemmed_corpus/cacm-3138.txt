a mathemat program updat method us modifi given transform and appli to lp problem an effici and numer stabl method is present for the problem of updat an orthogon decomposit of a matrix of column or row vector the fundament idea is to add a column or row analog to ad an addit row of data in a linear least squar problem a column or row is drop by a formal scale with the imaginari unit 1 follow by least squar addit of the column or row the elimin process for the procedur is success ssive applic of the given transform in modifi more effici form these idea ar illustr with an implement of the revis simplex method the algorithm is a gener purpos on that doe not account for ani particular structur or sparsiti in the equat some suggest comput test for determin sign of variou control paramet in the revis simplex algorithm ar mention a simpl mean of construct test case and some sampl comput time ar present cacm april 1979 hanson r wisniewski j linear program numer linear algebra modifi given transform linear program test case 5 5 4 5 41 5 1 5 14 ca790404 dh mai 21 1979 2 06 pm
