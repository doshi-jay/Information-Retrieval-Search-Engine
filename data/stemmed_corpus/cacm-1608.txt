numer integr of function that ha a pole it is common to need to integr numer function that diverg somewher outsid the rang of integr even if the diverg occur quit far awai integr formula like simpson s that depend on fit a polynomi usual will be inaccur near a pole thei will be veri bad a method is describ that give formula that will integr function of thi kind accur if the order and posit of the pole ar known explicit formula ar given that ar easi to us on an automat comput it is shown that thei can be us for some other singular as well as pole if the integr converg integr can be carri to the singular the accuraci of the integr with a pole of second order is discuss and as an exampl the new formula is compar with simpson s the new formula ar us even far from the pole while near the pole their advantag is overwhelm cacm april 1967 eisner e ca670407 jb februari 28 1978 11 20 am
