autom of etch pattern layout help heurist etch pattern layout program is an applic program develop to computer the tediou and error prone although vital import wire design of print circuit board help help autom a design stage on step closer to product than logic design it can be us to design wire pattern of two layer circuit board on which ic in dual in line packag as well as discret compon such as transistor and resistor have been place help emploi two method of wire on is the heurist method which simul human approach to wire design and the other is the theoret interest but time consum method of maze run base on the lee s algorithm help perform more than 90 percent of requir wire by the heurist path with respect to a perform function for each point to point and point to line connect it can bring the number of success wire connect veri close to 100 percent cacm novemb 1971 aramaki i kawabata t kazuhiko a heurist etch pattern layout wire design of print circuit board maze run lee s algorithm 3 24 3 66 4 9 6 9 ca711104 jb februari 2 1978 10 58 am
