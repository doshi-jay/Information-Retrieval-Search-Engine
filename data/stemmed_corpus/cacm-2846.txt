compress tri thi paper present a new data structur call a compress trie or c trie to be us in inform retriev system it ha the same underli m ari tree structur as a trie where m is a paramet of the trie but wherea the field of the node in a trie have to be larg enough to hold a kei or at least a pointer the field in a c trie ar onli on bit long in the analysi part of the paper it will be shown that for a collect of n kei the retriev time measur in term of bit inspect of on kei is of the order logm n and the storag requir of the order n m log2 n bit thi improv in storag requir and retriev time is achiev at the cost of decreas the flexibl of the structur and therefor updat cost ar increas first the c trie is analyz as a data structur and then sever method of it us for rel static databas ar discuss cacm juli 1976 mali k data structur databas m ari tree trie retriev time storag requir kei 3 70 3 74 3 75 ca760707 jb januari 4 1978 12 26 pm
