a fast algorithm for comput longest common subsequ previous publish algorithm for find the longest common subsequ of two sequenc of length n have had a best case run time of o n 2 an algorithm for thi problem is present which ha a run time of o r n log n where r is the total number of order pair of posit at which the two sequenc match thu in the worst case the algorithm ha a run time of o n 2 log n howev for those applic where most posit of on sequenc match rel few posit in the other sequenc a run time of o n log n can be expect cacm mai 1977 hunt j w szymanski t g longest common subsequ effici algorithm 3 73 3 63 5 25 ca770509 jb decemb 29 1977 1 46 am
