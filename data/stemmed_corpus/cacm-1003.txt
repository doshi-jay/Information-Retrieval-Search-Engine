a comput analysi method for thermal diffus in biochem system in the thermal detect of rapid biochem reaction it is necessari to correct the temperatur data for transient heat conduct loss in a cylindr calorimet to handl the complex aris from vari thermal relax time of concentr insul layer a comput program wa develop which give the temperatur distribut of the system as a function of radiu and time thi distribut is correct at each step by a subroutin which calcul the instantan chemic state of there action as well as the heat produc by thi reaction the program is base on a direct statement of fourier s law of heat conduct and the chemic rate equat to provid a bookkeep law to follow the reactant and the flow of heat packet in such a wai that the comput continu store the heat distribut a comput analysi method is here regard as on in which the physic law of a process ar us explicitli in the program usual thi result in by pass much of the mathemat procedur convention us the program wa test against some known exact solut of the heat equat and gave ident result and compar well with experiment data of a known biochem reaction the construct of comput program base on the direct statement of the physic law is a principl of gener applic which ha been appli to sever other physic phenomena cacm septemb 1964 david n berger r l ca640908 jb march 9 1978 5 13 pm
