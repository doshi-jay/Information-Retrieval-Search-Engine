a parametr algorithm for draw pictur of solid object compos of quadric surfac an algorithm for draw pictur of three dimension object with surfac made up of patch of quadric surfac is describ the emphasi of thi algorithm is on calcul the intersect of quadric surfac a parameter scheme is us each quadric surfac intersect curv qsic is repres as a set of coeffici and paramet limit each valu of the paramet repres at most two point and these mai easili be distinguish thi scheme can find the coordin of point of even quartic fourth order intersect curv us equat of no more than second order method of parameter for each type of osic ar discuss as well as surfac bound and hidden surfac remov cacm octob 1976 levin j comput graphic hidden surfac remov quadric surfac intersect curv 3 41 5 12 5 13 5 19 8 2 ca761004 jb januari 3 1978 4 32 pm
