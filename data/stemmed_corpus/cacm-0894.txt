an iter factor techniqu for polynomi an iter techniqu is displai wherebi factor of arbitrari degre can be found for polynomi in on variabl converg is shown to occur alwai if a certain jacobian doe not vanish and if the initi approxim to a factor is near enough to an actual factor the process is simpli program and preliminari result indic it to be well adapt to us with digit comput for factor of degre two the techniqu is similar to that of bairstow the present method be somewhat simpler cacm march 1963 luther h a ca630326 jb march 14 1978 12 51 pm
