optim binari tree grown with a sort algorithm item can be retriev from binari tree grown with a form of the algorithm quicksort in an averag time proport to log n where n is the number of item in the tree the binari tree grown by thi algorithm sometim have some branch longer than other therefor it is possibl to reduc the averag retriev time by restructur the tree to make the branch as uniform in length as possibl an algorithm to do thi is present the us of thi algorithm is discuss and it is compar with anoth which restructur the tree after each new item is ad cacm februari 1972 martin w a ness d n retriev inform from binari tree global and local optim sort recurs 3 74 5 31 ca720203 jb januari 31 1978 4 30 pm
