comput gener of gamma random variat with non integr shape paramet when the shape paramet a is integr gener gamma random variabl with a digit comput is straightforward there is no simpl method for gener gamma random variat with non integr shape paramet a common procedur is to approxim gener such random variabl by us of the so call probabl switch method anoth procedur which is exact is due to johnk thi paper present a reject method for exactli gener gamma random variabl when a is greater than 1 the effici of the reject method is shown to be better than the effici of johnk s method the paper conclud that when a is non integr the follow mix of procedur yield the best combin of accuraci and effici 1 when a is less than 1 us johnk s method 2 when 1 is less than a and a is less than 5 us the reject method 3 when a is greater than 5 us the probabl switch method cacm decemb 1974 wallac n d simul gamma random variabl probabl distribut random number 5 5 8 1 ca741205 jb januari 16 1978 9 35 am
