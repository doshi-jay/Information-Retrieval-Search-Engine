an optim insert algorithm for on side height balanc binari search tree an algorithm for insert an element into a on side height balanc oshb binari search tree is present the algorithm oper in time o log n where n is the number of node in the tree thi repres an improv over the best previou ly known insert algorithm of hirschberg and kosaraju which requir time o log 2n moreov the o log n complex is optim earlier result have shown that delet in such a structur can also be perform in o log n time thu the result of thi paper give a neg answer to the question of whether such tree should be the first exampl of their kind where delet ha a smaller time complex than insert furthermor it can now be conclud that insert delet and retriev in oshb tree can be perform in the same time as the correspond oper for the more gener avl tree to within a constant factor howev the insert and delet algorithm for oshb tree appear much more complic than the correspond algorithm for avl tree cacm septemb 1979 raiha k zweben s insert on side height balanc tree height balanc tree binari tree search tree 3 73 3 74 4 34 5 25 5 31 ca790904 db januari 14 1980 11 47 am
