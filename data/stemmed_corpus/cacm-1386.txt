symbol factor of polynomi in sever variabl an algorithm for find the symbol factor of a multi variat polynomi with integ coeffici is present the algorithm is an extens of a techniqu us by kroneck in a proof that the prime factor of ani polynomi mai be found in a finit number of step the algorithm consist of factor singl variabl instanc of the given polynomi by kroneck s method and introduc the remain variabl by interpol techniqu for implement the algorithm and sever exampl ar discuss the algorithm promis suffici power to be us effici in an onlin system for symbol mathemat cacm august 1966 jordan d e kain r y clapp l c ca660812 jb march 2 1978 7 06 pm
