a note on minim length polygon approxim to a digit contour a method for extract a smooth polygon contour from a digit imag is illustr the order sequenc of contour point and the connect graph of the imag ar first obtain by a modifi ledlei algorithm in on imag scan a minim perimet polygon subject to specifi constraint is then chosen as the approxim contour the determin of the minim polygon can be reduc to a nonlinear program problem solv by an algorithm which take into account the weak bond between variabl some exampl ar present and the correspond comput time ar list cacm januari 1970 montanari u digit imag connect tree minim polygon optim approxim nonlinear program 3 63 5 13 5 17 ca700106 jb februari 14 1978 2 00 pm
