further remark on line segment curv fit us dynam program in a recent paper bellman show how dynam program could be us to determin the solut to a problem previous consid by stone the problem compris the determin given n of the n point of subdivis of a given interv a b and the correspond line segment that give the best least squar fit to a function g x in the interv bellman confin himself primarili to the analyt deriv suggest briefli howev how the solut of the equat deriv for each particular point of subdivis u i could be reduc to a discret search in thi paper the comput procedur is consid more fulli and the similar to some of stone s equat ar indic it is further shown that an equat for u i involv no minim mai be found in addit it is shown how bellman s method mai be appli to the curv fit problem when the addit constraint ar ad that the end of the line segment must be on the curv cacm august 1962 gluss b ca620831 jb march 17 1978 9 19 pm
