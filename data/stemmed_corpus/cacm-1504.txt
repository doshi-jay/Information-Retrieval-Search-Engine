algorithm for find a fundament set of cycl for an undirect linear graph given the adjac matrix of the graph the algorithm present in thi paper find a span tree and then construct the set of fundament cycl our algorithm is slower than an algorithm present by welch by a ratio of n 3 n is the number of node but requir less storag for graph with a larg number of node and edg when storag is limit our algorithm is superior to welch s howev when the graph ar small or machin storag is veri larg welch s algorithm is superior time estim and storag requir for both method ar present cacm decemb 1967 gotlieb c c corneil d g ca671204 jb februari 26 19782 35 pm
