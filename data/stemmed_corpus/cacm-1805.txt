product of multiprogram comput progress in develop an analyt predict method multiprogram as it is discuss here is a mode of comput oper in which two or more program ar concurr in processor memori and proceed each us the same central processor unit cpu and input output i o channel these program ar actual proceed intermitt and singli accord to elig readi to proce and prioriti it is us to be abl to repres them as proceed continu and simultan each at an effect rate which mai be a fraction of that which it would enjoi in the absenc of the other program the effect progress rate of each program is sensit to mani detail characterist of itself and it co resid and simul ha been the best avail method of predict it thi paper present the result of progress in develop an altern to simul a simul test iter comput of these rate under certain situat the algorithm is sensit to most of the factor that control the phenomenon includ nonquantit or topolog featur of the program structur cacm decemb 1969 lasser d j product predict multiprogram simul equip evalu hardwar evalu monitor oper system system softwar supervisor perform time share time slice 2 43 2 44 4 32 ca691207 jb februari 15 1978 2 47 pm
