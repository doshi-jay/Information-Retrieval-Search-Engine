on comput the fast fourier transform coolei and tukei have propos a fast algorithm for comput complex fourier transform and have shown major time save in us it to comput larg transform on a digit comput with n a power of two comput time for thi algorithm is proport to n log2 n a major improv over other method with comput time proport to n 2 in thi paper the fast fourier transform algorithm is briefli review and fast differ equat method for accur comput the need trigonometr function valu ar given the problem of comput a larg fourier transform on a system with virtual memori is consid and a solut is propos thi method ha been us to comput complex fourier transform of size n 2 16 on a comput with 2 15 word of core storag thi exce by a factor of eight the maximum radix two transform size with fix alloc of thi amount of core storag the method ha also been us to comput larg mix radix transform a scale plan for comput the fast fourier transform with fix point arithmet is also given cacm octob 1967 singleton r c ca671008 jb februari 27 1978 2 03 pm
