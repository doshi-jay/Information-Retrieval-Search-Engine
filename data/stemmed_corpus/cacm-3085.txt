an o n algorithm for determin a near optim comput order of matrix chain product thi paper discuss the comput of matrix chain product of the form m1 x m2 x x mn where mi s ar matric the order in which the matric ar comput affect the number of oper a suffici condit about the associ of the matric in the optim order is present an o n algorithm to find an order of comput which take less than 25 percent longer than the optim time topt is also present in most case the algorithm yield the optim order or an order which take onli a few percent longer than topt less than 1 percent on the averag cacm juli 1978 chin f approxim algorithm heurist algorithm matrix multipl matrix chain product 5 14 ca780703 dh februari 8 1979 2 46 pm
