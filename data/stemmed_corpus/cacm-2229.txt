construct of ration and neg power of a formal seri some method ar describ for the gener of fraction and neg power of ani formal seri such as poisson seri or chebyshev seri it is shown that with the us of the three elementari oper of addit subtract and multipl all ration posit and neg power of a seri can be construct there ar basic two approach the binomi theorem and the iter method both method ar describ here and the relationship between them is point out some well known classic formula ar obtain as particular case and it is shown how the converg properti of these formula can be improv with veri littl addit comput final at the end of the articl some numer experi ar describ with chebyshev seri and with fourier seri cacm januari 1971 bruck r a seri expans seri invers root extract binomi theorem newton iter chebyshev seri poisson seri fourier seri 3 11 3 15 3 21 5 0 ca710105 jb februari 8 1978 10 57 am
