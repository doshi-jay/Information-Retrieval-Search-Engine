a bound storag algorithm for copi cyclic structur a new algorithm is present which copi cyclic list structur us bound workspac and linear time unlik a previou similar algorithm thi on make no assumpt about the storag alloc system in us and us onli oper like to be avail in a high level languag the distinct featur of thi algorithm is a techniqu for travers the structur twice us the same span tree in each case first from left to right and then from right to left cacm june 1977 robson j m copi share subtre cyclic structur 4 49 5 25 ca770609 jb decemb 28 1977 12 56 pm
