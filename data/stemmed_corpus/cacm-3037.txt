a linear siev algorithm for find prime number a new algorithm is present for find all prime between 2 and n the algorithm execut in time proport to n assum that multipl of integ not larger than n can be perform in unit time the method ha the same arithmet complex as the algorithm present by mairson 6 howev our version is perhap simpler and more eleg it is also easili extend to find the prime factor of all integ between 2 and n in time proport to n cacm decemb 1978 gri d misra j prime algorithm data structur 5 25 5 24 5 29 ca781202 dh januari 22 1979 11 12 am
