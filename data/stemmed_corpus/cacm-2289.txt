cellular arrai for the solut of graph problem a cellular arrai is a two dimension checkerboard type interconnect of ident modul or cell where each cell contain a few bit of memori and a small amount of combin logic and commun mainli with it immedi neighbor in the arrai the chief comput advantag offer by cellular arrai is the improv in speed achiev by virtu of the possibl for parallel process in thi paper it is shown that cellular arrai ar inher well suit for the solut of mani graph problem for exampl the adjac matrix of a graph is easili map onto an arrai each matrix element is store in on cell of the arrai and typic row and column oper ar readili implement by simpl cell logic a major challeng in the effect us of cellular arrai for the solut of graph problem is the determin of algorithm that exploit the possibl for parallel especi for problem whose solut appear to be inher serial in particular sever parallel algorithm ar present for the solut of certain span tree distanc and path problem with direct applic to wire rout pert chart analysi and the analysi of mani type of network these algorithm exhibit a comput time that in mani case grow at a rate not exceed log2 n where n is the number of node in the graph straightforward cellular implement of the well known serial algorithm for these problem requir about n step and noncellular implement requir from n 2 to n 3 step cacm septemb 1972 levitt k n kautz w h graph theori cellular logic in memori arrai parallel process special purpos comput algorithm for distanc and span tree problem 5 32 6 22 6 5 ca720901 jb januari 30 1978 9 16 am
