a simpl algorithm for comput the gener invers of a matrix the gener invers of a matrix is import in analysi becaus it provid an extens of the concept of an invers which appli to all matric it also ha mani applic in numer analysi but it is not wide us becaus the exist algorithm ar fairli complic and requir consider storag space a simpl extens ha been found to the convent orthogon method for invert non singular matric which give the gener invers with littl extra effort and with no addit storag requir the algorithm give the gener invers for ani m by n matrix a includ the special case when m n and a is non singular and the case when m n and rank a n in the first case the algorithm give the ordinari invers of a in the second case the algorithm yield the ordinari least squar transform matrix inv a a a and ha the advantag of avoid the loss of signific which result in form the product a a explicitli cacm mai 1966 rust r burru w r schneeberg c ca660514 jb march 3 1978 9 22 am
