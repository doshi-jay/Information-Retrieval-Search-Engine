on the normal requir of divisor in divid and correct method thi paper present an analysi on the normal requir of the divisor in a divid and correct method thi analysi is made subject to the condit that not more than on correct is requir to obtain the true quotient charact from the trial estim got from the divis of a two precis segment of everi partial remaind by a suitabl round singl precis divisor thi segment divis is denot here as a 2 1 precis basic divis it is found that the normal requir could be narrow down to a smaller rang of divisor provid the magnitud of the charact next to the lead charact of the divisor is known if howev the normal is to be elimin on ha to choos proper higher precis segment of operand for the basic divis also consid is the possibl of elimin the normal by an increas on the number of correct on the quotient estim got from a 2 1 precis basic divis it is shown that such a scheme is econom onli for small radic cacm decemb 1967 krishnamurthi e v nandi s k ca671210 jb februari 26 1978 2 15 pm
