parallel method for integr ordinari differenti equat thi paper is dedic to the proposit that in order to take full advantag for real time comput of highli parallel comput as can be expect to be avail in the near futur much of numer analysi will have to be recast in a more parallel form by thi is meant that serial algorithm ought to be replac by algorithm which consist of sever subtask which can be comput without knowledg of the result of the other subtask as an exampl a method is propos for parallel the numer integr of an ordinari differenti equat which process by all standard method is entir serial cacm decemb 1964 nievergelt j ca641221 jb march 9 1978 3 09 pm
