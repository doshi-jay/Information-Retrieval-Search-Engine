a note on inform organ and storag sinc the logic structur of a data base can be repres by a tree or graph it is quit natur for us to view the process of design a data base as that of construct a tree or a graph a gener method for construct such a tree or a graph is provid there ar three import element in thi gener construct method name a set of binari relat an algorithm for construct subset of a set and an algorithm for select an element from the given set of object the us of differ relat and algorithm result in differ inform structur as list tree ring etc thu the problem of inform organ and storag is reduc to that of defin relat and formul algorithm under a given set of constraint the result present mai be valuabl to design as us design concept and mai serv as a basi for develop a formal theori on the subject cacm juli 1973 huang j c data base data base manag inform retriev inform structur file organ storag alloc tree graph 3 70 3 73 3 74 5 32 ca730702 jb januari 23 1978 1 14 pm
