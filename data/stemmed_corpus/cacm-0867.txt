least squar fit of plane to surfac us dynam program dynam program ha recent been us by stone by bellman and by gluss to determin the closet fit of broken line segment to a curv in an interv under the constraint that the number of segment is fix in the present paper success model ar develop to extend the method to the fit of broken plane segment to surfac z g x y defin over certain type of subarea of the x y space the first model consid a rectangular area with the constraint that the plane segment ar defin over a grid in the x y space it is then shown how thi model mai be incorpor into an algorithm that provid success approxim to optim fit for ani type of close area final applic ar briefli describ cacm april 1963 gluss b ca630424 jb march 14 1978 11 43 am
