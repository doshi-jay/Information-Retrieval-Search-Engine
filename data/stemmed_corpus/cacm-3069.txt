a practic interprocedur data flow analysi algorithm a new interprocedur data flow analysi algorithm is present and analyz the algorithm associ with each procedur in a program inform about which variabl mai be modifi which mai be us and which ar possibl preserv by a call on the procedur and all of it subcal the algorithm is suffici power to be us on recurs program and to deal with the share of variabl which aris through refer paramet the algorithm is uniqu in that it can comput all of thi inform in a singl pass not requir a prepass to comput call relationship or share pattern the algorithm is asymptot optim in time complex it ha been implement and is practic even on program which ar quit larg cacm septemb 1978 barth j data flow analysi global flow analysi optim side effect relat refer paramet incarn 4 12 4 20 ca780903 dh februari 5 1979 3 07 pm
