note on tripl precis float point arithmet with 132 bit number in a recent paper gregori and ranei describ a techniqu for doubl precis float point arithmet a similar techniqu can be develop for tripl precis float point arithmet and it is the purpos of thi note to describ thi techniqu onli the multipl and the divis algorithm ar describ sinc the addit subtract algorithm can be obtain by a trivial modif of the algorithm in gregori s and ranei s paper cacm march 1965 ikeb y ca650313 jb march 7 1978 5 54 pm
