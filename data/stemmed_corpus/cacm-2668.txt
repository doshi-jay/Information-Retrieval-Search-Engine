comput of page fault probabl from program transit diagram an algorithm is given for calcul page fault probabl in a virtual memori system oper under demand page with variou memori size and replac rule a first order markov model of program behavior is assum and a represent of the system base on memori state control state and memori substat is present the algorithm is gener in the sens that the page fault probabl can be calcul for nonpredict replac rule appli to ani program repres by a on step markov chain a detail exampl is given to illustr the algorithm for random and least recent us lru replac rule cacm april 1974 franklin m a gupta r k virtual memori demand page replac rule program model program behavior markov model page fault page fault probabl 4 30 6 20 ca740402 jb januari 18 1978 10 31 am
