a simpl automat deriv evalu program a procedur for automat evalu of total partial deriv of arbitrari algebra function is present the techniqu permit comput of numer valu of deriv without develop analyt express for the deriv the kei to the method is the decomposit of the given function by introduct of intermedi variabl into a seri of elementari function step a librari of elementari function subroutin is provid for the automat evalu and differenti of these new variabl the final step in thi process produc the desir function s deriv the main featur of thi approach is it simplic it can be us as a quick reaction tool where the deriv of analyt deriv is labori and also as a debug tool for program which contain deriv cacm august 1964 wengert r e ca640801 jb march 9 1978 7 38 pm
