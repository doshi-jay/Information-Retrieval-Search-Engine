optim shift strategi for a block transfer ccd memori for the purpos of thi paper a block transfer ccd memori is compos of serial shift regist whose shift rate can vari but which have a definit minimum shift rate the refresh rate and a definit maximum shift rate the bit iin the shift regist ar number 0 to n 1 and block of n bit ar alwai transfer alwai start at bit 0 what is the best shift strategi so that a block transfer request occur at a random time will have to wait the minim amount of time befor bit 0 can be reach the minimum shift rate requir doe not allow on to simpli park at bit 0 and wait for a transfer request the optim strategi involv shift as slowli as possibl until bit 0 is pass then shift as quickli as possibl until a critic boundari is reach shortli befor bit 0 come around again thi is call the hurri up and wait strategi and is well known outsid the comput field the block transfer ccd memori can also be view as a page drum with a variabl bound rotat speed cacm mai 1978 site r page drum charg coupl devic shift regist memori memori hierarchi electron drum latenc 3 72 5 39 6 34 6 35 ca780510 dh februari 26 1979 1 05 pm
