on the optim detect of curv in noisi pictur a techniqu for recogn system of line is present in thi techniqu the heurist of the problem is not embed in the recognit algorithm but is express in a figur of merit a multistag decis process is then abl to recogn in the input pictur the optim system of line accord to the given figur of merit due to the global approach greater flexibl and adequaci in the particular problem is achiev the relat between the structur of the figur of merit and the complex of the optim process is then discuss the method describ is suitabl for parallel process becaus the oper rel to each state can be comput in parallel and the number of stage is equal to the length n of the curv or to log2 n if the approxim method is us cacm mai 1971 montanari u pictur process pictur recognit pictur descript curv detect line detect edg detect optim detect heurist method global recognit parallel process dynam program interact graph secondari optim problem 3 63 3 66 5 42 ca710504 jb februari 3 1978 2 49 pm
