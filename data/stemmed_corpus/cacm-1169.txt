an algorithm for minim backboard wire function a partial exhaust algorithm is present for solv the follow problem aris from automat layout of a comput given an order set e1 e2 en of n comput compon for each permut of the element e1 e2 en there is attach a valu of an integ function f the algorithm find a local minimum of f by evalu the set delta f of the increment correspond to a certain set of exchang of two elementshen the exchang correspond to the least neg increment of delta f is perform the process is iter and stop when the set of the increment is a posit or empti set which it is prove correspond to a minimum the procedur is similar to the downhil method for find the minimum of a real function f p and can be appli to other placement problem experiment result ar present with backboard form by mani element and differ initi placement cacm novemb 1965 pomental t ca651112 jb march 6 1978 4 35 pm
