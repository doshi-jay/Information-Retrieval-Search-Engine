subgoal induct a proof method subgoal induct is present as an altern or supplement to the commonli us induct assert method it major virtu is that it can often be us to prove a loop s correct directli from it input output specif without the us of an invari the relat between subgoal induct and other commonli us induct rule is explor and in particular it is shown that subgoal induct can be view as a special form of comput induct a set of suffici condit ar present which guarante that an input output specif is strong enough for the induct step of a proof by subgoal induct to be valid cacm april 1977 morri j h jr wegbreit b program verif prove program correct induct rule comput induct induct assert structur induct proof rule recurs program iter program 4 19 4 22 5 21 5 24 ca770401 jb decemb 29 1977 6 31 am
