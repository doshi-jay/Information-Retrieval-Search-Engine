analysi of decai type data a compar studi ha been made of a varieti of numer techniqu for fit experiment data of the decai type by form involv the sum of exponenti statist error of the fit paramet ar also calcul these method have been appli to artifici gener set of data as well as to the result of experi with radioact tracer on both human and anim subject result show that the valu of the fit paramet ar veri sensit to variat in the fit procedur therefor great care veri sensit to variat in the fit procedur therefor great care must be exercis in identifi such valu with physic constant although the valu of function deriv from these fit paramet which can definit be associ with physic entiti ar gener more stabl under variat in the fit techniqu error bound can be so larg that no great confid can be place even in them it would therefor appear best to select a uniform techniqu both for run the experi and for analyz the data and then to consid as signific onli rel result between on subject and the next cacm januari 1964 worslei b h ca640112 jb march 10 1978 5 11 am
