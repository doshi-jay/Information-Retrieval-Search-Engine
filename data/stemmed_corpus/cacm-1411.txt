comparison of sever algorithm for comput of mean standard deviat and correl coeffici sever algorithm for comput of basic statist ar compar by their perform on systemat gener test data the statist calcul were the mean standard deviat and correl coeffici for each statist the algorithm includ the usual comput formula correct due to an accumul error term and a recurs comput of the current valu of the statist the usual comput formula were also evalu in doubl precis larg error were note for some calcul us the usual comput formula the most reliabl techniqu wa correct of the initi estim by us of an accumul error term to elimin the need for make two pass on the data it wa suggest that the initi estim of the mean be obtain from a subset of the data cacm juli 1966 neeli p m ca660703 jb march 6 1978 2 54 pm
