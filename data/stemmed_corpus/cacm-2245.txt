trace driven model and analysi of cpu schedul in multiprogram system microscop level job stream data obtain in a product environ by an event driven softwar probe is us to drive a model of a multiprogram comput system the cpu schedul algorithm of the model is systemat vari thi techniqu call trace driven model provid an accur replica of a product environ for the test of variat in the system at the same time alter in schedul method can be easili carri out in a control wai with caus and effect relationship be isol the schedul method test includ the best possibl and worst possibl method the tradit method of multiprogram theori round robin first come first serv etc and dynam predictor the rel and absolut perform of these schedul method ar given it is conclud that a success cpu schedul method must be preemptiv and must prevent a given job from hold the cpu for too long a period cacm decemb 1972 sherman s baskett iii f brown j c schedul cpu schedul multiprogram perform measur trace driven model 4 10 4 20 4 31 4 32 ca721210 jb januari 27 1978 10 57 am
