a unifi approach to schedul thi paper present a scheme for classifi schedul algorithm base on an abstract model of a schedul system which formal the notion of prioriti variou class of schedul algorithm ar defin and relat to exist algorithm a criterion for the implement effici of an algorithm is develop and result in the definit of time invari algorithm which includ most of the commonli implement on for time invari algorithm the depend of process rate on prioriti is deriv the abstract model provid a framework for implement flexibl schedul in real oper system the polici driven schedul of bernstein and sharp is discuss as an exampl of such an implement cacm juli 1977 ruschitzka m fabri r s schedul algorithm schedul model prioriti oper system processor share implement effici 4 31 4 32 4 34 4 35 8 1 ca770702 jb decemb 28 1977 12 32 pm
