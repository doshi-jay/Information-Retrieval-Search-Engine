a simpl proof of lewin s order retriev theorem for associ memori an effici method of order retriev of binari word from an associ memori as describ by lewin is base on the us of special readout circuit which indic the digit valu present in the individu digit column of the memori thu the circuit indic whether the individu digit column contain digit of both valu or of onli on valu or contain no digit at all i e that the memori is empti the us of these circuit which in thi paper ar term column valu indic reduc consider the number of memori access necessari to retriev in order a number of distinct word from the memori lewin prove that for the readout by the describ method of m distinct binari word 2m 1 memori access ar necessari thu he prove that the number of necessari memori access of hi method unlik those of other method is independ of the word length in thi paper a veri simpl proof of thi theorem deriv from some elementari aspect of the structur of set of binari number is present cacm juli 1968 wolinski a associ memori content address memori order list order inform retriev order retriev theorem column digit valu digit valu varieti column sens arrang digit valu readout digit varieti readout memori access memori access frequenc order retriev effici access frequenc proof retriev theorem proof 3 74 3 79 5 29 5 31 6 31 6 36 ca680704 jb februari 22 1978 12 24 pm
