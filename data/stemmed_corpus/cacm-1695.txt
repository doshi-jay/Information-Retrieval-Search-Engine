plexu an on line system for model neural network a descript is present of plexu a system which enabl a user to construct and specifi a neural network to analyz the output data produc by the network and to store and retriev network and data from a librari the system oper entir from a digit displai unit interact directli with the user and permit easi and rapid transit between the variou phase of the model process plexu is design to complement neurophysiolog research so that the systemat develop of neural model can be coordin with experiment work plexu network ar built up from compon repres individu neuron extern stimuli and interconnect fiber each compon be of a rel detail natur provis is also made for the us of experiment data as input to a network conveni mean for specif and modif of a network and extens error check capabl ar provid data result from the simul of a network mai be analyz by a varieti of techniqu rang from examin of the gross characterist of the data to the determin of detail statist properti cacm septemb 1968 dill j c randal d l richer i biolog model data analysi discret system simul librari system model network simul neural network neurophysiolog model on line simul simul 3 12 3 19 3 29 3 65 ca680906 jb februari 22 1978 8 56 am
