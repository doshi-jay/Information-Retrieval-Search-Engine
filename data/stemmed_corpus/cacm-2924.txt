an interact comput graphic approach to surfac represent an in teract comput graphic method ha been develop for the rapid gener of arbitrari shape three dimension surfac the method is a synthesi of spline theori and algorithm an in teract mean for man machin commun and softwar for static or dynam graphic displai the basic techniqu emploi is a modifi loft method on which section curv ar repres by uniform b spline and the surfac is in terpol between section by cardin spline among the featur of thi method ar algorithm which enabl in teract modif of the b spline represent of the section curv at all stage of the process the spatial inform is graphic displai to the user complex surfac can be creat by the combin of a number of shape that have been separ gener and automat join the system ha been successfulli in terfac to a varieti of analyt routin for structur medic and graphic applic cacm octob 1977 wu sheng chuan abel j f greenberg d p comput graphic three dimension surfac represent spline loft finit element input method 3 20 3 23 3 34 8 1 8 2 ca771002 jb decemb 27 1977 11 53 am
