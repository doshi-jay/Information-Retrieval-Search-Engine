a graph formul of a school schedul algorithm the problem classic titl the examin schedul problem take variou form in the literatur most of these formul can be present in the terminolog of classic network theori on such formul is given a nondirect network partit it node into a minim number of subset such that no two member of the same subset ar connect by anarc an obviou lower limit to thi number is the size of the largest strongli connect subgraph kirchgassn prove that an upper limit is thi size plu on on logic extens of the previou work is the introduct of variabl length examin where w i is the number of period for exam i the object of thi paper is to gener the definit of largest strongli connect subgraph to includ the weight of node to present an approxim algorithm which usual find the largest strongli connect subgraph and to discuss the applic of thi algorithm to the solut of school schedul and exam schedul problem cacm decemb 1974 salazar a oakford r v schedul school schedul examin schedul nondirect network graph subgraph strongli connect subgraph 3 51 3 52 ca741206 jb januari 13 1978 4 37 pm
