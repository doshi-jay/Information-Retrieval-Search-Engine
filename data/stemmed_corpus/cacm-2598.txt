extend the inform theori approach to convert limit entri decis tabl to comput program thi paper modifi an earlier algorithm for convert decis tabl into flowchart which minim subsequ execut time when compil into a comput program the algorithm consid in thi paper perform limit search and accordingli do not necessarili result in global optim solut howev the greater search effort need to obtain a global optim solut for complex decis tabl is usual not justifi by suffici save in execut time there is an analog between the problem of convert decis tabl into effici flowchart and the well understood problem in inform theori of noiseless code the result of the noiseless code literatur ar us to explor the limit of algorithm us to solv the decis tabl problem the analog between the two problem is also us to develop improv to the inform algorithm in extend the depth of search under certain condit and in propos addit condit to be ad to the decis tabl final the inform algorithm is compar with an algorithm propos in a recent paper by verhelst cacm septemb 1974 shwayder k code decis tabl flowchart inform theori noiseless channel sort 3 50 5 31 ca740910 jb januari 17 1978 8 40 am
