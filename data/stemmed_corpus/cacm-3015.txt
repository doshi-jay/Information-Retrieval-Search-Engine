relax method for imag reconstruct the problem of recov an imag a function of two variabl from experiment avail integr of it gray over thin strip is of great import in a larg number of scientif area an import version of the problem in medicin is that of obtain the exact densiti distribut within the human bodi from x rai projectionsn approach that ha been taken to solv thi problem consist of translat the avail inform into a system of linear inequ the size and the sparsiti of the result system typic 25 000 inequ with fewer than 1 percent of the coeffici nonzero make method us success relax computation attract as compar to other wai of solv system of inequ in thi paper it is shown that for a consist system of linear inequ ani sequenc of relaxarion paramet ly strictli between 0 and 2 gener a sequenc of vector which converg to a solut under the same assumpt for a system of linear equat the relax method converg to the minimum norm solut previous propos techniqu ar shown to be special case of our procedur with differ choic of relax paramet the practic consequ for imag reconstruct of the choic of the relax paramet ar discuss cacm februari 1978 herman g lent a lutz p biomed imag process imag reconstruct x rai tomographi mathemat program linear inequ relax techniqu 3 12 3 17 3 34 3 63 5 14 5 18 5 41 ca780208 jb march 28 1978 2 13 pm
