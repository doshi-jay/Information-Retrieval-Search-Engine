spline function method for nonlinear boundari valu problem the solut of the nonlinear differenti equat y f x y y with two point boundari condit is approxim by a quintic or cubic spline function y x the method is well suit to nonuniform mesh size and dynam mesh size alloc for uniform mesh size h the error in the quintic spline y x is o h 4 with typic error on third that from numerov s method requir the differenti equat to be satisfi at the mesh point result in a set of differ equat which ar block tridiagon and so ar easili solv by relax or other standard method cacm june 1969 blue j l boundari valu problem differenti equat finit differ function approxim iter method nonlinear equat spline function 5 13 5 15 5 17 ca690605 jb februari 17 1978 11 07 am
