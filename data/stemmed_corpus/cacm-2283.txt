thin algorithm on rectangular hexagon and triangular arrai in thi report three thin algorithm ar develop on each for us with rectangular hexagon and triangular arrai the approach to the develop of each algorithm is the same pictori result produc by each of the algorithm ar present and the rel perform of the algorithm ar compar it is found that the algorithm oper with the triangular arrai is the most sensit to imag irregular and nois yet it will yield a thin imag with an overal reduc number of point it is conclud that the algorithm oper in conjunct with the hexagon arrai ha featur which strike a balanc between those of the other two arrai cacm septemb 1972 deutsch e s thin algorithm rectangular hexagon triangular arrai imag process skeleton 3 64 ca720907 jb januari 27 1978 4 25 pm
