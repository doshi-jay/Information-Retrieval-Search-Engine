detect of combin occurr in thi paper it is suppos that the variabl x1 xn each have finit rang with the variabl xi take on pi possibl valu and that the valu of the variabl ar chang with time it is suppos further that it is desir to detect occurr in which some subset of the variabl achiev particular valu final it is suppos that the problem involv the detect of a larg number of combin occurr for a larg number of chang of valu of variabl two effici solut for thi problem ar describ both method have the unusu properti of be faster for system where the sum p1 pn is larger the first solut is error free and suitabl for most case the second solut is slightli more eleg and allow negat as well as conjunct but is subject to the possibl of error an error analysi is given for the second method and an empir studi is report cacm januari 1977 zobrist a l carlson f r jr code hash code retriev secondari kei pattern recognit artifici in tellig demon n tupl sort chess 3 63 5 31 ca770104jb januari 3 1978 12 15 am
