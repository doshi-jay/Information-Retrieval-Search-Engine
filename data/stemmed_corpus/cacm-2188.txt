an approach to the optimum design of comput graphic system displai system design ar face with the difficult task of select major subsystem in an intellig wai each subsystem is chosen from larg number of altern the select is base on consider such as system respons time system cost and the distribut of data storag and process between the graphic processor and it support data process system the work report here develop an object quantit design procedur and help give a better understand of now to configur displai system thi is accomplish by mean of a mathemat model of a comput driven graphic system the paramet of the model ar function of the capabl of the graphic hardwar and of the comput requir of the graphic applic the model can be analyz us numer queue analysi or simul to obtain an averag respons time predict by combin the model with an optim the best graphic system configur subject to a cost constraint is found for sever applic the optimum configur ar in turn us to find gener displai system design guidelin cacm june 1971 folei j d design guidelin graphic displai system mathemat model optimum system design queue model 3 8 6 22 6 35 ca710602 jb februari 3 1978 10 26 am
