digit synthesi of correl stationari nois in thi note we propos a method of gener stationari nois with a prescrib auto covari function by digit method the need for such a techniqu often aris in test the perform of data process and engin system where input corrupt with correl nois of a known form ar requir the techniqu is quit simpl and produc strict sens stationari nois which agre approxim with r t the prescrib auto covari function acf over an interv t 0 t 0 the method consist of approxim the spectral densiti by a period process with spectral line and then synthes the period nois with random phase and appropri amplitud in order to simplifi discuss of the statist properti of the nois gener the techniqu is first present in term of exact harmon analysi in practic discret harmon analysi as present in the third section is us cacm juli 1962 peabodi p r adorno d s ca620728 jb march 17 1978 7 59 pm
