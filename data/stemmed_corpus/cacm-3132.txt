experi with some algorithm that find central solut for pattern classif in two class pattern recognit it is a standard techniqu to have an algorithm find hyperplan which separ the two class in a linearli separ train set the tradit method find a hyperplan which separ all point in the other but such a hyperplan is not necessarili center in the empti space between the two class sinc a central hyperplan doe not favor on class or the other it should have a lower error rate in classifi new point and is therefor better than a noncentr hyperplan six algorithm for find central hyperplan ar test on three data set although frequent us practic the modifi relax algorithm is veri poor three algorithm which ar defin in the paper ar found to be quit good cacm march 1979 slagl j pattern recognit pattern classif linear discrimin central hyperplan center central criteria dead zone hyperplan linearli separ relax algorithm acceler relax 3 62 3 63 ca790303 dh april 12 1979 3 20 pm
