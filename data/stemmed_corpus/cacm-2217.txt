experi in automat learn for a multipurpos heurist program an automat learn capabl ha been develop and implement for us with the multipl multipurpos program that learn heurist tree search program which is present be appli to resolut theorem prove in predic calculu multipl s prove program pp us two evalu function to guid it search for a proof of whether or not a particular goal is achiev thirteen gener featur of predic calculu claus were creat for us in the automat learn of better evalu function for pp a multipl regress program wa us to produc optim coeffici for linear polynomi function in term of the featur also automat data handl routin were written for pass data between the learn program and the prove program and for analyz and summar result data wa gener collect for learn regress analysi from the experi of pp a number of experi were perform to test the effect and gener of the learn program result show that the learn produc dramat improv in the solut to problem which were in the same domain as those us for collect learn data learn wa also shown to gener successfulli to domain other than those us for data collect anoth experi demonstr that the learn program could simultan improv perform on problem in a specif domain and on problem in a varieti of domain some variat of the learn program were also test cacm februari 1971 slagl j r farrel c d learn theorem provid heurist automat learn self modifi tree search artifici intellig problem solv adapt lisp multipl regress resolut 3 62 3 64 ca710204 jb februari 8 1978 9 33 am
