multidimension binari search tree us for associ search thi paper develop the multidimension binari search tree or k d tree where k is the dimension of the search space as a data structur for storag of inform to be retriev by associ search the k d tree is defin and exampl ar given it is shown to be quit in it storag requir a signific advantag of thi structur is that a singl data structur can handl mani type of queri veri effici variou util algorithm ar develop their proven averag run time in an n record file ar insert o log n delet of the root o n k 1 k delet of a random node o log n and optim guarante logarithm perform of search o n log n search algorithm ar given for partial match queri with t kei specifi proven maximum run time of o n k t k and for nearest neighbor queri empir observ averag run time of o log n these perform far surpass the best current known algorithm for these task an algorithm is present to handl ani gener intersect queri the main focu of thi paper theoret it is felt howev that k d tree could be quit us in mani applic and exampl of potenti us ar given cacm septemb 1975 bentli j l associ retriev binari search tree kei attribut inform retriev system nearest neighbor queri partial match queri intersect queri binari tree insert 3 63 3 70 3 74 4 49 ca750902 jb januari 6 1978 3 22 pm
