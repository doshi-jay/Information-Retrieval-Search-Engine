on the stabil of gauss jordan elimin with pivot the stabil of the gauss jordan algorithm with partial pivot for the solut of gener system of linear equat is commonli regard as suspect it is shown that in mani respect suspicion ar unfound and in gener the absolut error in the solut is strictli compar with that correspond to gaussian elimin with partial pivot plu back substitut howev when a is ill condit the residu correspond to the gauss jordan solut will often be much greater than that correspond to the gaussian elimin solut cacm januari 1975 peter g wilkinson j h gauss jordan algorithm gaussian elimin back substitut backward error analysi bound for error in solut bound for residu 5 11 5 14 ca750104 jb januari 12 1978 10 44 am
