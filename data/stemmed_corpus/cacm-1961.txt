an effici search algorithm to find the elementari circuit of a graph a theoret most effici search algorithm is present which us an exhaust search to find all of the elementari circuit of a graph the algorithm can be easili modifi to find all of the elementari circuit with a particular attribut such as length a rigor proof of the algorithm is given as well as an exampl of it applic empir bound ar present relat the speed of the algorithm to the number of vertic and the number of arc the speed is also relat to the number of circuit in the graph to give a relat between speed and complex extens to undirect and s graph ar discuss cacm decemb 1970 tiernan j c algorithm graph theori circuit search algorithm path search algorithm search 3 74 5 32 ca701202 jb februari 9 1978 4 12 pm
