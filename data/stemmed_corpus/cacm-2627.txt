schedul independ task to reduc mean finish time sequenc to minim mean finish time or mean time in system is not onli desir to the user but it also tend to minim at each point in time the storag requir to hold incomplet task in thi paper a determinist model of independ task is introduc and new result ar deriv which extend and gener the algorithm known for minim mean finish time in addit to present and analyz new algorithm it is shown that the most gener mean finish time problem for independ task is polynomi complet and henc unlik to admit of a non enum solut cacm juli 1974 bruno j coffman e g jr sethi r minim mean finish time minim mean flow time sequenc algorithm optim schedul algorithm determinist schedul model 4 32 5 39 ca740704 jb januari 17 1978 12 56 pm
