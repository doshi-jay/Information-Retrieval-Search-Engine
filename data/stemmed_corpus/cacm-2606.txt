a new integr algorithm for ordinari differenti equat base on continu fraction approxim a new integr algorithm is found and an implement is compar with other program algorithm the new algorithm is a step by step procedur for solv the initi valu problem in ordinari differenti equat it is design to approxim pole of small integ order in the solut of the differenti equat by continu fraction obtain by manipul the sum of truncat taylor seri expans the new method is compar with gragg bulirsh stoer and the taylor seri method the taylor seri method and the new method ar shown to be superior in speed and accuraci while the new method is shown to be most superior when the solut is requir near a singular the new method can final be seen to pass automat through singular where all the other method which ar discuss will have fail cacm septemb 1974 willer i m ordinari differenti equat initi valu problem integr taylor seri singular continu fraction program comparison 5 17 ca740902 jb januari 17 1978 9 06 am
