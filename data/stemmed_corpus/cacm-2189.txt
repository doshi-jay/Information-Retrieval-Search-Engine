gener of rosari permut express in hamiltonian circuit systemat gener of a specif class of permut fundament to schedul problem is describ in a nonori complet graph with n vertic hamitonian circuit equival to 5 n 1 specif permut of n element term rosari permut can be defin each of them correspond to two circular permut which mirror imag each other and is gener success by a number system cover 3 4 n 1 set of edg everi set of edg e k 1 e k k 3 k n 1 is determin recurs by construct a hamiltonian circuit with k vertic from a hamiltonian circuit with k 1 vertic start with the hamiltonian circuit of 3 vertic the basic oper consist of transposit of a pair of adjac vertic where the posit of the pair in the permut is determin by e k two algorithm treat the same exampl for five vertic ar present it is veri easi to deriv all possibl n permut from the 5 n 1 rosari permut be cycl the permut and by take them in the revers order procedur which can be perform fairli effici by comput cacm june 1971 harada k permut graph theori schedul combinatori algebra 5 32 5 39 ca710601 jb februari 3 1978 1 55 pm
