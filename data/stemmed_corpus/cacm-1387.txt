solut of system of polynomi equat by elimin the elimin procedur as describ by william ha been code in lisp and formac and us in solv system of polynomi equat it is found that the method is veri effect in the case of small system where it yield all solut without the need for initi estim the method by itself appear in appropri howev in the solut of larg system of equat due to the explos growth in the intermedi equat and the hazard which aris when the coeffici ar truncat a comparison is made with difficulti found in other problem in non numer mathemat such as symbol integr and simplif cacm august 1966 mose j ca660811 jb march 2 1978 7 11 pm
