optim hi togram match by monoton grai level transform thi paper investig the problem of optim hi togram match us monoton grai level transform which alwai assign all pictur point of a given grai level i to anoth grai level t i such that if i j then t i t j the object is to find a transform digit pictur of a given pictur such that the sum of absolut error between the grai level hi togram of the transform pictur and that of a refer pictur is minim thi is equival to place k1 linearli order object of differ size on by on into k2 linearli order box of assort size such that the accumul error of space under pack or overpack in the box is minim the placement function is monoton which ensur a polynomi time solut to thi problem a tree search algorithm for optim hi togram match is present which ha time complex o k1 x k2 if the monoton properti is drop then the problem becom np complet even if it is restrict to k2 2 cacm octob 1978 chang s wong y optim hi togram match grai level transform pack problem tree search algorithm pictur process 3 24 5 25 5 42 ca781004 dh januari 29 1979 6 08 pm
