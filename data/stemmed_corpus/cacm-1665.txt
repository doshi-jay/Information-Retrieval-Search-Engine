automat gener of effici lexic processor us finit state techniqu the practic applic of the theori of finit state automata to automat gener lexic processor is dealt with in thi tutori articl by the us of the a rword system develop at m as part of the a 1 system thi system accept as input descript of the multicharact item or of word allow in a languag given in term of a subset of regular express the output of the system is a lexic processor which read a string of charact and combin them into the item as defin by the regular express each output item is identifi by a code number togeth with a pointer to a block of storag contain the charact and charact count in the item the processor produc by the system ar base on finit state machin each state of a machin correspond to a uniqu condit in the lexic process of a charact string at each state a charact is read and the machin chang to a new state at each transit appropri action ar taken base on the particular charact read the system ha been in oper sinc 1966 and processor gener have compar favor in speed to carefulli hand code program to accomplish the same task lexic processor for a o and mad ar among the mani which have been produc the techniqu emploi ar independ of the natur of the item be evalu if the word event is substitut for charact string these processor mai be describ as gener decis make mechan base upon an order sequenc of event thi allow the system to be us in a rang of applic outsid the area of lexic process howev conveni these advantag mai be speed is the most import consider in design a system for automat gener of a lexic processor the goal wa a processor which complet elimin backup or reread which wa nearli as fast as hand code processor which would analyz the languag and detect error and which would be conveni and easi to us cacm decemb 1968 johnson w l porter j h acklei s i ross d t charact string compil finit state automata finit state machin lexic processor nondeterminist machin pars plex structur regular express sequenti machin syntact analysi 3 63 3 75 4 12 5 22 5 24 5 31 ca681201 jb februari 21 1978 2 19 pm
