a fast and usual linear algorithm for global flow analysi abstract onli complet paper jacm 23 1 januari 1976 a new algorithm for global flow analysi on reduc graph is present the algorithm is shown to treat a veri gener class of function space for a graph of e edg the algorithm ha a worst case time bound of o e log e function oper it is also shown that in program term the number of oper is proport to e plu the number of exit from program loop consequ a restrict to on entri on exit control structur linear the algorithm can be extend to yet larger class of function space and graph by relax the time bound exampl ar given of code improv problem which can be solv us the algorithm cacm decemb 1975 graham s l wegman m global flow analysi data flow code optim common subexpress elimin live dead analysi inform propag flow graph reduc go to less program depth first search path compress 4 12 5 24 5 25 5 32 ca751206 jb januari 5 1978 4 08 pm
