find zero of a polynomi by the q d algorithm a method which find simultan all the zero of a polynomi develop by h rutishaus ha been test on a number of polynomi with real coeffici thi slowli converg method the quotient differ q d algorithm provid start valu for a newton or a bairstow algorithm for more rapid converg necessari and suffici condit for the exist of the q d scheme ar not complet known howev failur mai occur when zero have equal or nearli equal magnitud success wa achiev in most of the case tri with the failur usual traceabl to the equal magnitud difficulti in some case comput roundoff mai result in error which spoil the scheme even if the q d algorithm doe not give all the zero it will usual find a major of them cacm septemb 1965 henrich p watkin b o ca650908 jb march 6 1978 7 21 pm
