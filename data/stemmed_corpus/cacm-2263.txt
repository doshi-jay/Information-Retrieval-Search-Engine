the convers of limit entri decis tabl to optim and near optim flowchart two new algorithm two new algorithm for deriv optim and near optim flowchart from limit entri decis tabl ar present both take into account rule frequenc and the time need to test condit on of the algorithm call the optimum find algorithm lead to a flowchart which truli minim execut time for a decis tabl in which simpl rule ar alreadi contract to complex rule the other on call the optimum approach algorithm requir mani fewer calcul but doe not necessarili produc the optimum flowchart the algorithm ar first deriv for treat decis tabl not contain an els rule but the optimum approach algorithm is shown to be equal valid for tabl includ such a rule both algorithm ar compar with exist on and ar appli to a somewhat larg decis tabl deriv from a real case from thi comparison two conclus ar drawn 1 the optimum approach algorithm will usual lead to better result than compar exist on and will not requir more but usual less comput time 2 in gener the greater comput effort need for appli the optimum find algorithm will not be justifi by the small reduct in execut time obtain cacm novemb 1972 verhelst m decis tabl flowchart preprocessor optim program search 3 50 3 59 4 19 4 29 4 49 5 31 ca721106 jb januari 27 1978 2 10 pm
