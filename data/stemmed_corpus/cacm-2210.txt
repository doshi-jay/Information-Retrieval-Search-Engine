toward automat program synthesi an elementari outlin of the theorem prove approach to automat program synthesi is given without dwell on technic detail the method is illustr by the automat construct of both recurs and iter program oper on natur number list and tree in order to construct a program satisfi certain specif a theorem induc by those specif is prove and the desir program is extract from the proof the same techniqu is appli to transform recurs defin function into iter program frequent with a major gain ineffici it is emphas that in order to construct a program with loop or with recurs the principl of mathemat induct must be appli the relat between the version of the induct rule us and the form of the program construct is explor in some detail cacm march 1971 manna z walding r j artifici intellig answer extract automat program synthesi mathemat induct principl problem solv theorem prove 3 64 5 23 5 24 ca710302 jb februari 3 1978 4 48 pm
