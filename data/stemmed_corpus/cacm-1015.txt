near minimax polynomi approxim and partit of interv a method of near minimax polynomi approxim is describ as a by product thi method provid a formula for an estim of the maximum error associ with a given degre of approxim us thi formula a partit algorithm is obtain for divid a basic interv into subinterv for which approxim of equal degre give equal maximum error cacm august 1964 fraser w hart j f ca640815 jb march 9 1978 6 41 pm
