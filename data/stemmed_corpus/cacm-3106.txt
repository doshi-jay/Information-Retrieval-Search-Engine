a fast algorithm for copi list structur an algorithm is present for copi an arbitrarili link list structur into a block of contigu storag locat without destroi the origin list apart from a fix number of program variabl no auxiliari storag such as a stack is us the algorithm need no mark bit and oper in linear time it is shown to be significantli faster than fisher s algorithm the fastest previou linear time algorithm for the same problem it speed come mainli from it effici list travers techniqu which fold the process stack into the structur be built and from it classif of list cell into nine type which enabl process oper to be optim for each type cacm mai 1978 clark d list copi lisp space complex constant workspac 4 34 4 49 5 25 ca780501 dh februari 26 1979 3 25 pm
