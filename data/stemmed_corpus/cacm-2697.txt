a fast method for solv a class of tridiagon linear system the solut of linear system have real symmetr diagon domin tridiagon coeffici matric with constant diagon is consid it is prove that the diagon of the lu decomposit converg when float point precis it is also prove that the comput lu decomposit converg when float point arithmet is us and that the limit of the lu diagon us float point ar roughli within machin precis of the limit us real arithmet thi fact is exploit to reduc the number of float point oper requir to solv a linear system from 8n 7 to 5n 2k 3 where k is much less than n the order of the matrix if the element of the subdiagon and superdiagon ar 1 then onli 4n 2k 3 oper ar need the entir lu decomposit take k word of storag and consider save in arrai subscript ar achiev upper and lower bound on k ar obtain in term of the ratio of the coeffici matrix diagon constant and paramet of the float point number system variou gener of these result ar discuss cacm januari 1974 malcolm m a palmer j numer linear algebra linear system toeplitz matric tridiagon matric 5 5 1 5 11 5 14 5 17 ca740102 jb januari 18 1978 2 50 pm
