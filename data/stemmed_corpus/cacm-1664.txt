an algorithm for deriv the equat of mathemat physic by symbol manipul a method is describ wherebi a digit comput can be us to deriv the equat of mathemat physic in ani curvilinear coordin system request by the user the effect of the techniqu is demonstr by us it to deriv the navier stoke equat of fluid motion and the continu equat to deriv these equat by thi method the user need know onli the coordin transform equat relat the curvilinear coordin of interest to an orthogon cartesian triad when thi program is us and the coordin transform equat ar suppli as input the comput will deriv the navier stoke equat and the continu equat the equat obtain will be rel to the curvilinear coordin system specifi by the transform equat us as input in thi paper the emphasi is on theoret consider and methodolog rather than on program detail result ar present for cylindr polar and spheric polar coordin system cacm decemb 1968 howard j c tashjian h formac navier stroke equat continu equat tensor tensor equat curvilinear coordin system fortran symbol manipul 3 21 3 25 3 29 4 12 4 29 ca681202 jb februari 21 1978 2 02 pm
