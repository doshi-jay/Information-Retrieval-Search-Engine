model for parallel process within program applic to cpu i o and i o i o overlap approxim queue model for intern parallel process by individu program in a multiprogram system ar develop in thi paper the solut techniqu is develop by network decomposit the model ar formul in term of cpu i o and i o i o overlap and appli to the analysi of these problem the percentag perform improv from cpu i o overlap is found to be greatest for system which ar in approxim cpu i o util balanc and for low degre of multiprogram the percentag improv from i o i o overlap is found to be greatest for systemtem in which the i o system is more util than the cpu cacm octob 1978 towslei d chandi k brown j multiprogram parallel process queue network model multiprocess of comput and i o 4 32 8 1 ca781002 dh januari 29 1979 6 23 pm
