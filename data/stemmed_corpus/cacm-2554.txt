reduct of a band symmetr gener eigenvalu problem an algorithm is describ for reduc the gener eigenvalu problem ax lambda bx to an ordinari problem in case a and b ar symmetr band matric with b posit definit if n is the order of the matrix and m the bandwidth the matric a and b ar partit into m by m block and the algorithm is describ in term of these block the algorithm reduc the gener problem to an ordinari eigenvalu problem for a symmetr band matrix c whose bandwidth is the same as a and b the algorithm is similar to those of rutishaus and schwartz for the reduct of symmetr matric to band form the calcul c requir order mn 2 oper the round off error in the calcul of c is of the same order as the sum of the error at each of the n m step of the algorithm the latter error be larg determin by the condit of b with respect to invers cacm januari 1973 crawford c r gener eigenvalu symmetr band matric 5 14 ca730107 jb januari 24 1978 4 26 pm
