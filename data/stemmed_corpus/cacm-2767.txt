a comparison of simul event list algorithm four algorithm ar consid which can be us to schedul event in a gener purpos discret simul system two of the algorithm ar new on is base on an end order tree structur for event notic and anoth us an index linear list the algorithm ar test with a set of typic stochast schedul distribut especi chosen to show the advantag and limit of the algorithm the end order tree algorithm is shown to be an advantag immedi replac for the algorithm in us with current simul languag the most promis algorithm us the index list concept it will requir an adapt routin befor it can be emploi in gener purpos simul but it perform is such that further studi would be fruit cacm april 1975 vaucher j g duval p simul time flow mechan event list algorithm simul time flow mechan event list algorithm simul execut event schedul routin discret system simul sort 3 74 4 22 8 1 ca750410 jb januari 9 1978 3 43 pm
