an applic of heurist search method to edg and contour detect thi paper present a method for detect edg and contour in noisi pictur the properti of an edg ar embed in a figur of merit and the edg detect problem becom the problem of minim the given figur of merit thi problem can be repres as a shortest path problem on a graph and can be solv us well known graph search algorithm the relat between thi represent of the minim problem and a dynam program approach ar discuss show that the graph search method can lead to substanti improv in comput time moreov if heurist search method ar us the comput time will depend on the amount of nois in the pictur some experiment result ar given these show how variou inform about the shape of the contour of an object can be embed in the figur of merit thu allow the extract of contour from noisi pictur and the separ of touch object cacm februari 1976 martelli a pictur process pattern recognit edg detect contour detect contour follow optim problem dynam program shortest path heurist search method problem solv method 3 63 3 64 3 66 5 42 ca760204 jb januari 5 1978 9 30 am
