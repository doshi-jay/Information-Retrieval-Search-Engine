n dimension code for detect and correct multipl error the paper introduc a new famili of code for detect and correct multipl error in a binari code messag the messag itself is arrang conceptu into a multidimension rectangular arrai the process of encod and error detect ar base upon pariti evalu along prescrib dimens of the arrai effect of the code is increas by introduc a system check bit which is essenti a pariti check on the other pariti bit onli three dimension code ar discuss in thi paper with pariti evalu along the horizont the vertic and on main diagon howev the famili of code is not restrict to three dimens as evidenc by the discuss by minnick and ashenhurst on a similar multidimension singl bit select plan us for anoth purpos 6 a four dimension code correct three and detect four error ha been develop the extens to higher dimension code with greater correct power is straightforward cacm decemb 1961 rubinoff m ca611207 jb march 15 1978 10 23 pm
