storag util in a memori hierarchi when storag assign is perform by a hash algorithm the util of storag is studi in a two level memori hierarchi the first storag level which is the fast store is divid into a number of storag area when an entri is to be file in the hierarchi a hash algorithm will attempt to place the entri into on of these area if thi particular area is full then the entri will be place into the slower second level store even though other area in the first level store mai have space avail given the n entri have been file in the entir hierarchi an express is deriv for the expect number of entri file in the first level storehi express give a measur of how effect the first level store is be us by mean of exampl storag util is then studi as a function of the hash algorithm the number of storag area into which the first level store is divid and the total size of the first level store cacm march 1971 william j g hash algorithm memori alloc memori hierarchi memori util storag alloc storag hierarchi storag util 3 74 4 3 ca710304 jb februari 3 1978 4 37 pm
