prove termin with multiset order a common tool for prove the termin of program is the well found set a set order in such a wai as to admit no infinit descend sequenc the basic approach is to find a termin function that map the valu of the program variabl into some well found set such that the valu of the termin function is repeatedli reduc throughout the comput all too often the termin function requir ar difficult to find and ar of a complex out of proport to the program under consider multiset bag over a given well found set s ar set that admit multipl occurr of element taken from s the given order on s induc an order on the finit multiset over s thi multiset order is shown to be well found the multiset order enabl the us of rel simpl and intuit termin function in otherwis difficult termin proof in particular the multiset order is us to prove the termin of product system program defin in term of set of rewrit rule cacm august 1979 dershowitz n manna z program correct program termin program verif well found order well found set multiset bag product system term rewrit system tree replac system reduct rule 5 24 5 7 ca790803 db januari 4 1980 3 44 pm
