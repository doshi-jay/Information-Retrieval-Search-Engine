optimum merg from mass storag an algorithm is displai which yield the merg order such that the total read time defin to be the sum of seek time plu data transfer time is minim for a sort us mass storag the analysi is parameter in term of the ratio of seek time to the time it take to fill avail core with record and the file size in unit of core length and thu it can be appli to ani convent cpu mass storag combin an explicit formula for total read time is deriv in term of the paramet which correl veri well with the total read time calcul us the optimum merg order yield by the algorithm the formula involv the root of a simpl transcendent equat a short tabl of these root is includ numer result ar graphic displai for a wide rang of the paramet it is found that the normal read time for optimum merg on a given hardwar configur is proport to the file length time the logarithm of the file length cacm decemb 1970 black n a sort merg optimum merg mass storag sort time drum merg access time 3 37 4 49 5 31 ca701207 jb februari 9 1978 3 18 pm
