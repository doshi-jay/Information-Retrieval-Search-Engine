on a class of iter formula and some histor note the class of iter formula obtain by ration approxim of euler s formula is deriv with the correspond error estim some histor note on iter procedur ar follow by a deriv of euler s formula with the associ error estim in a new notat which simplifi the error estim and suggest gener the final section consid the pade approxim to the euler polynomi and show how a number of known formula mai be deriv from thi unifi approach there is a short discuss of the best formula cacm june 1961 traub j f ca610606 jb march 16 1978 10 36 pm
