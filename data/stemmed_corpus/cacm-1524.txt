a stop criterion for polynomi root find when search for the root of a polynomi it is gener difficult to know just when to accept a number as an adequ approxim to the root in thi paper an algorithm is present which allow on to termin the iter process on the basi of calcul bound for the roundoff error which occur in evalu the polynomi thi stop criterion ha been test on numer exampl and ha been found to serv as a satisfactori mean for accept a complex number as a zero of a real polynomi cacm octob 1967 adam d a ca671009 jb februari 27 1978 1 56 pm
