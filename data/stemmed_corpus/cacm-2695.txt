tridiagon by permut tridiagon a matrix by similar transform is an import comput tool in numer linear algebra consid the class of spars matric which can be tridiagon us onli row and correspond column permut the advantag of us such a transform includ the absenc of round off error and improv comput time when compar with standard transform a graph theoret algorithm which examin an arbitrari n x n matrix and determin whether or not it can be permut into tridiagon form is given the algorithm requir no arithmet while the number of comparison the number of assign and the number of increment ar linear in n thi compar veri favor with standard transform method if the matrix is permut into tridiagon form the algorithm give the explicit tridiagon form otherwis earli reject will occur cacm januari 1974 gibb n e pool w g jr tridiagon matrix permut algorithm eigenvalu graph bandwidth spars matrix 5 14 5 32 ca740104 jb januari 18 1978 2 31 pm
