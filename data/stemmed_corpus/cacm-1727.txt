on wai of estim frequenc of jump in a program for the segment of a program it is us to have a reason estim of the valu of s ij where s ij is the mean valu of the number of jump from the i th instruct on to the j th instruct in the run time in the case where the s ij ar estim directli the structur of the whole program must be gener taken into account therefor it is veri difficult for the programm and or the translat to obtain a good estim of the s ij it is easier to estim not s ij but the quantiti p ij s ij c i sum s ij j 1 n where c i is an arbitrari posit constant for each i although the p ij ar for each i proport to s ij the estim of p ij is easier becaus we must estim onli the probabl of event where instruct i is execut after instruct i i thi estim can often be done without consid the structur of the whole program in the first part of the paper us the theori of the markov chain an algorithm for the comput of the s ij from the p ij is found and some wai of obtain estim of the p ij ar given in the second part a variant of thi algorithm is deriv avoid the necess of comput involv larg matric cacm juli 1968 kral j object program reduct supervisor call decreas jump frequenc estim control transfer estim optim program segment markov chain program correspond program graph on entri subgraph local estim jump frequenc supervisor overhead decreas program segment algorithm jump frequenc program segment problem 4 11 4 19 4 39 4 49 ca680702 jb februari 22 1978 3 05 pm
