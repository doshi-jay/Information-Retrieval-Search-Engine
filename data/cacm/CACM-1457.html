Data Manipulation and Programming Problems
in Automatic Information Retrieval

Automatic information retrieval programs require
the manipulation of a variety of different 
data structures, including linear text, sparse matrices,
and tree or list structures.  The main data 
manipulations to be performed in automatic information
systems are first briefly reviewed.  A variety 
of data representations which have been used to describe
structured information are then examined, and 
the characteristics of various processing languages are
outlined in the light of the procedures requiring 
implementation.  Advantages of these programming languages
for the retrieval application are examined, 
and suggestions are made for the design of programming
facilities to aid in information retrieval.
