FLOWTRACE, A Computer Program for Flowcharting Programs

The FLOWTRACE system produces flowcharts of programs
written in "almost any" programming language. 
 One most describe the syntax of the control statements
in his language; for this purpose a metalanguage 
is available.  The resultant object deck is used to
flowchart any programs in the language described. 
 Several examples of FAP and SNOBOL flowcharts are given.
 However, it is not necessary to confine one's 
scope to existing languages.  One may define his own
language in any "well-structured" manner.  This 
feature is particularly useful when it is desirable
to chart only comments within a program.  Such an 
approach permits the documentation of descriptive remarks
and avoids the inclusion of coding details.
