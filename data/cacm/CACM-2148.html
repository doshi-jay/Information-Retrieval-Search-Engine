The Composition of Semantics in Algol 68

The main features of Algol 68 are explained
from a semantic point of view.  It is shown how 
the language permits the composition of values and actions,
i.e. ultimately programs, from a minimum 
set of primitives with a few fundamental recursive rules
of composition.  The associated syntax is briefly 
reviewed.  An attempt has been made to obtain a structured
and simple introduction to both Algol 68 and 
its orthogonal design.
