Preliminary Report on a System for General Space Planning

A computer language and a set of programs within
that language are described which allow the 
formulating and solving of a class of space planning
problems.  The language is an extension of Algol 
and includes means to represent spaces and objects, to manipulate
them, and to test the resulting arrangements 
according to a variety of constraints.  The algorithms
used to solve problems expressed in this language 
rely on heuristic programming.  Both the language
and the search algorithms are detailed.
