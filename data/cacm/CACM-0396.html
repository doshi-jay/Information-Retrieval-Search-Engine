   Automation of Program  Debugging

   Automatic Debugging can substantially reduce lead-time between the coding
and the effective use of a complex program. It also enforces analysis of
debugging criteria, resulting in verifiably accurate programs. The programmer
specifies the program to be debugged, memory areas, set of input data, maximum
repetition of loops, and checkpoint information for each set of data. The
executive debugging program the runs the program to be debugged, performing
checking functions and creating a trace record of its own later analysis and
location of errors. Applications are quite flexible, and the system can be used
alone or in conjunction with other debugging techniques.
