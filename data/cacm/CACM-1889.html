Introducing Computing to Smaller Colleges
and Universities -- A Progress Report

By technical means that are now routine, computer
service for smaller colleges and universities 
can be provided by remote terminals of a central facility.
 Access, however, is not enough-effective 
organizational and educational methodology for introducing
computing at such institutions must also be 
developed.  The experience of two years with a statewide
network involving-41 institutions is discussed. 
 Lessons include the importance of a separate organization
representing the small colleges, the necessity 
for on-campus training for the institutions, the need
for some special programming and documentation 
to support such users,and the development of curriculum by evolutionary means.
