Reducing Truncation Errors Using Cascading Accumulators

When accumulating a large number of quantities
as in numerical integration, the sum itself 
may become much larger than the individual addends.
 This results in truncation error.  Much of this 
error can be eliminated using cascading accumulators
as noted in a recent article by Wolfe.  A simpler 
and slightly more flexible algorithm is presented which
deals also with the case of negative addends.
