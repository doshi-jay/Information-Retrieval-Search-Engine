Optimal Shift Strategy for a Block-Transfer CCD Memory

For the purposes of this paper, a block-transfer
CCD memory is composed of serial shift registers 
whose shift rate can vary, but which have a definite minimum
shift rate (the refresh rate) and a definite 
maximum shift rate.  The bits iin the shift registers
are numbered 0 to N - 1, and blocks of N bits are 
always transferred, always starting at bit 0.   What
is the best shift strategy so that a block transfer 
request occurring at a random time will have to wait the
minimal amount of time before bit 0 can be reached? 
 The minimum shift rate requirement does not allow one
to  simply "park" at bit 0 and wait for a transfer 
request.  The optimal strategy involves shifting as slowly
as possible until bit 0 is passed, then shifting 
as quickly as possible until a critical boundary is
reached, shortly before bit 0 comes around again. 
 This is called the "hurry up and wait" strategy and is well
known outside the computer field.  The block-transfer 
CCD memory can also be viewed as a paging drum
with a variable (bounded) rotation speed.
