An Information Algebra - Phase I Report-Language
Structure Group of the CODASYL Development Committee

This report represents the results of the
first phase of the work of the Language Structure 
Group.  The goal of this work is to arrive at a proper
structure for a machine-independent problem-defining 
language, at the systems level of data processing.  The
report is based, for the most part, on a mathematical 
model called "An Information Algebra" developed primarily
by R. Bosak.  It is hoped that this report 
will be read (a) with avid interest by programming language
designers and implementors, and all those 
interested in developing a theoretical approach to data
processing; (b) with interest and understanding 
by professional programmers and systems analysts; and (c)
with appreciation by the businessman-analyst-manager. 
 The authors have not attempted an exhaustive discourse
in this report.  Rather, they have tried to present 
a philosophy to the professional people who are vitally
concerned with providing a working language for 
the systems analyst's use.  They trust that the ideas
in this report will stimulate others to think along 
similar lines.  Questions and comments will be welcomed,
and can be addressed to any of the members of 
the Language Structure Group:  Robert Bosak, System
Development Corporation;  Richard F. Clippinger, 
Honeywell EDP Division;  Carey Dobbs, Remington Rand
Univac Division;  Roy Goldfinger (Chairman), IBM 
Corporation;  Renee B. Jasper, Navy Management Office;
 William Keating, National Cash Register;  George 
Kendrick, General Electric Company;  Jean E. Sammet, IBM Corporation.
