Empirical Working Set Behavior

The working set model for program behavior
has been proposed in recent years as a basis for 
the design of scheduling and paging algorithms.  Although
the words "working set" are now commonly encountered 
in the literature dealing with resource allocation, there
is a dearth of published data on program measurements, 
in the hope that workers in the field might find experimental
evidence upon which to substantiate and 
base theoretical work.
