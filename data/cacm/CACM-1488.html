Programming Decision Tables in FORTRAN, COBOL or ALGOL

A simple broad-based approach for programming
decision tables in FORTRAN or COBOL is developed 
and presented.  With inputs in standard form, as defined
in the paper, the programming of any decision 
table can be done with one or two FORTRAN statements,
or with two COBOL statements, if the COMPUTE verb 
is available in the COBOL processor.  It is  shown
that the method is applicable even when there are 
more than two mutually exclusive states of one, two or
more table conditions.  It is further shown that 
multi-state conditions in decision tables can often
simplify the programming.  The method outlined has 
the further advantage that all possible combinations
of conditions are considered.  It is shown that 
the suggested procedure is easily implemented in ALGOL.
