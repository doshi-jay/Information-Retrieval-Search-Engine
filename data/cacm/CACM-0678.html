Optimizing Bit-time Computer Simulation

A major component of a bit-time computer simulation
program is the Boolean compiler.  The compiler 
accepts the Boolean functions representing the simulated computer's
digital circuits, and generates corresponding 
sets of machine instructions which are subsequently
executed on the "host" computer.  Techniques are 
discussed for increasing the sophistication of the Boolean
compiler so as to optimize bit-time computer 
simulation.  The techniques are applicable to any general-purpose computer.
