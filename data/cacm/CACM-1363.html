A General Method of Systematic Interval Computation
for Numerical Integration of Initial Value 
Problems

A procedure is given for continuously computing
and monitoring the step size to be used by 
a self-starting, p-th order numerical integration method
to solve an initial value problem.  The procedure 
uses an estimate of the truncation error to calculate the step size.
