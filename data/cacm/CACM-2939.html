Abstraction Mechanisms in CLU

CLU is a new programming language designed to support
the use of abstractions in program construction. 
 Work in programming methodology has led to the realization
that three kinds of abstractions-procedural, 
control, and especially data abstractions-are useful
in the programming process.  Of these, only the 
procedural abstraction is supported well by conventional
languages, through the procedure or subroutine. 
 CLU provides, in addition to procedures, novel linguistic
mechanisms that support the use of data and 
control abstractions.  This paper provides an in troduction
to the abstraction mechanisms in CLU.  By 
means of programming examples, the utility of the three
kinds of abstractions in program construction 
is illustrated, and it is shown how CLU programs may
be written to use and implement abstractions.  The 
CLU library, which permits incremental program development
with complete type checking performed at compile 
time, is also discussed.
