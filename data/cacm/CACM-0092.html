A Checklist of Intelligence for Programming Systems

A remarkable variation exists in the degree
of sophistication of various programming systems. 
 A particular manifestation is the jungle of assorted
devices for reproducing limited human decision 
procedures.  An attempt is made here to begin a systematic
classification of the various devices for 
educating the computer to take over the decision-making
functions of one or many human operators, both 
those that have been demonstrated feasible to date and
those that are highly desirable for the future.
