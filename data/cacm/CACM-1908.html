Time-Sharing and Batch-Processing:  An Experimental
Comparison of Their Values in a Problem - 
Solving Situation

An experimental comparison of problem-solving
using time-sharing and batch-processing computer 
systems conducted at MIT is described in this paper.
 This study is the first known attempt to evaluate 
two such systems for what may well be the predominant user
population within the next decade-the professionals 
who, as nonprogrammers, are using the computer as an
aid in decision-making and problem-solving rather 
than as a programming end in itself.  Statistically
and logically significant results indicate equal 
cost for usage of the two computer systems; however,
a much higher level of performance is attained by 
time-sharing users.  There are indications that significantly
lower costs would have resulted if the 
time-sharing users had stopped work when they reached
a performance level equal to that of the batch 
users.  The users' speed of problem-solving and their
attitudes made time-sharing the more favorable 
system.
