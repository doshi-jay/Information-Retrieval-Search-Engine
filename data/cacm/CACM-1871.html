Automatic Contour Map

Some methods for contour mapping by means of
a digital plotter are discussed, and a new method 
is presented that is simple enough to be implemented by
programs with a rather small number of instructions 
(about 120 FORTRAN IV instructions are required).  Comparisons
with some methods proposed by other authors 
are also performed,  A FORTRAN IV program implementing
the proposed method is available at the Istituto 
di Elettrotecnica ed Elettronica, Politencnico di Milano.
