   An On-Line Program for Non-Numerical Algebra

   The goal of this program is to make a step toward te design of an automated
mathematical assistant. Some requirements for such a program are: it must be
easy to access, and that the result must be obtained in a reasonably short
time. Accordingly the program is written for a time-shared computer. The Q-32
computer as System Development Corporation, Santa Monica, California, was 
chosen because it also had a LISP 1.5 compiler. Programming and debugging was
done from a remote teletype console at Stanford University.
