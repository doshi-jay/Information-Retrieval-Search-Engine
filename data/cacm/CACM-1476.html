Control Procedures for Data Communication-An ASA Progress Report

Sectional Committee X.3 of the American Standards
Association, has charged one of its task 
groups, X3.3.4, with the responsibility to "Define and specify
functional control requirements and characteristics 
governing the operation of digital data generating and
receiving systems interconnected by communication 
system."  This effort is primarily directed toward systems
employing the American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange (ASCII).  This paper represents a progress
report on the work of this group toward a proposal 
for national and international standardization in the
field of control procedures.  It describes both 
the old and new work of the task group.  The new work
is presented in detail, while the work that has 
been presented in earlier papers ["Control Procedures for
Data Communication," Task Group document X3.3.4/44, 
May 1964: "Transparent-Mode Control Procedures for Data
Communication," Task Group document X3.3.4/58, 
December, 1964: Comm. ACM 8 (Apr. 1965), 203-206; "Control
Procedures for Data Communications," Task 
Group document X3.3.4/60, March, 1965] is retained here
in summary form.  Many of the concepts and principles 
described herein have been submitted to the International
Organization for Standardization via earlier 
papers and are now embodied in working papers of that organization.
