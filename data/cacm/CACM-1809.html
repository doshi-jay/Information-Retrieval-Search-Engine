Numerical Analysis in a Ph. Computer Science Program

Numerical Analysis is the study of methods and
procedures used to obtain "approximate solutions" 
to mathematical problems.  Much of the emphasis is on scientific
calculation.  The difficulties of education 
in such a broad area center around the question of background
and emphasis.  The Numerical Analysis program 
in the Computer Science Department should emphasize an
awareness of the problems of computer implementation 
and experimental procedures.  Nevertheless, there is a
need for a solid background in applied mathematics.
