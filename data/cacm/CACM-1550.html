A Comparison of Batch Processing and Instant Turnaround

A study of the programming efforts of students
in an introductory programming course is presented 
and the effects of having instant turnaround (a few minutes)
as opposed to conventional batch processing 
with turnaround times of a few hours are examined.  Among
the items compared are the number of computer 
runs per trip to the computation center, program preparation
time, keypunching time, debugging time, 
number of runs, and elapsed time from the first run
to the last run on each problem.  Even though the 
results are influenced by the fact that "bonus points"
were given for completion of a programming problem
in less than a specified number of runs, there
is evidence to support "Instant" over "Batch".
