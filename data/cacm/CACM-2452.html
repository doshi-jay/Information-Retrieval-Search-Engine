Evaluation and Selection of File Organization-A Model and System

This work first discusses the factors that
affect file (data base) organization performance, 
an elusive subject, and then presents a methodology, a
model and a programmed system to estimate primarily 
total storage costs and average access time of several
file organizations, given a specific data base, 
query characterization and device-related specifications.
 Based on these estimates, an appropriate file 
structure may be selected for the specific situation.
 The system is a convenient tool to study file 
structures and to facilitate as much as possible the process
of data base structure design and evaluation.
