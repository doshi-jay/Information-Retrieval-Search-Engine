A Comparison of the FORTRAN Language
Implementation for Several Computers

A feature-by-feature comparison is made of five
different implementations of FORTRAN IV representing 
three different manufacturers.  A table is constructed
showing, where possible, the use of each feature 
in each implementation.  Only those items which are
different from, or have been added to FORTRAN II 
are shown.
