A Model and Stack Implementation of Multiple Environments

Many control and access environment structures
require that storage for a procedure activation 
exist at times when control is not nested within the
procedure activated.  This is straightforward to 
implement by dynamic storage allocation with linked
blocks for each activation, but rather expensive 
in both time and space.  This paper presents an implementation
technique using a single stack to hold 
procedure activation storage which allows retention
of that storage for durations not necessarily tied 
to control flow.  The technique has the property that,
in the simple case,it runs identically to the 
usual automatic stack allocation and deallocation procedure.
 Applications of this technique to multitasking, 
coroutines, backtracking, label-valued variables, and
functional arguments are discussed.  In the initial 
model, a single real processor is assumed, and the implementation
assumes multiple-processes coordinate 
by passing control explicitly to one another.  A multiprocessor
implementation requires only a few changes 
to the basic technique, as described.
