Faster Retrieval from Context Trees (Corrigendum)

Context trees provide a convenient way of
storing data which is to be viewed as a hierarchy 
of contexts.  This note presents an algorithm which improves
on previous context tree retrieval algorithms. 
It is based on the observation that in typical uses context
changes are infrequent relative to retrievals, 
so that data can be cached to speed up retrieval.  A retrieval
is started from the position of the previous 
retrieval and auxiliary structures are built up to make
the search rapid.  Algorithms for addition and 
deletion of data and for garbage collection are outlined.
