Multi-attribute Retrieval with Combined Indexes

In this paper a file organization scheme designed to
replace the use of the popular secondary index filing scheme
(or inverted files on secondary key fields) is described.
Through the use of redundancy and storing 
keys (or access numbers of the records) that satisfy different combinations
of secondary index values in "buckets," it is possible to retrieve
all keys satisfying any input query derived from a subset of
fields by a single access to an index file, although each bucket may
be used for many combinations of values and a combination of
buckets may be required for a given query.  The method which, in its
degenerate case, becomes the conventional secondary index filing
scheme works similarly but has the following advantages: (1) the elimination
of multiple accesses in many cases; (2) the elimination
of false drops; (3) the elimination of computer time to perform intersection
of key sets each qualified for one secondary index field
only; and (4) the avoidance of long strings of keys when an index
field appearing in a query has very few possible values.  Redundancy, in some 
cases, is the same as the secondary indexing method. In the general case, 
trade-off between the number of accesses for query and redundancy exists.
