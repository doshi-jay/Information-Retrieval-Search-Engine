A Programming System for the On-line Analysis of Biomedical Images

A preliminary description of the software for a computer-display
system is given with special emphasis on the  man-machine interaction. This 
system is intended for a wide variety of biomedical applications.
As an example, the methods are applied to the karyotyping of chromosomes.  The 
system is separated into four programming tasks: picture transformations, file 
maintenance, picture structuring, and display management.  Picture structuring
is considered as the vehicle for man-machine communication.
A prototype data format for pictures, called a picture-form, is developed.
Structure operators are defined which manipulate picture-forms to produce 
new pictures-forms.  Many of the ideas are taken from the symbolic mathematical 
laboratory at MIT conceived by Marvin Minsky.
