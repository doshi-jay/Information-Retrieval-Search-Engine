Storage Organization in Programming Systems

The system of program and data representation
that has been in use on the Rice University computer 
for five years is described.  Each logical entity in storage
occupies a block of consecutive memory locations. 
 Each block is labeled by a codeword and may contain
a program, a data vector, or codewords which in 
turn label blocks to form arrays.  This storage arrangement
is discussed with its realized advantages 
or programming systems: simplicity of programmed addressing,
flexibility of data structures, efficiency 
of memory utilization, variability of system composition
during execution, means of linkage between programs 
and from programs to data, and basis for storage protection.
 The application of labeled blocks may be 
extended to areas of time-sharing and multimedia storage
control.  On the basis of experience at rice, 
some ideas on such extensions are presented.
