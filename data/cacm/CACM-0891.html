Everyman's Information Retrieval System

The information retrieval problem whose solution
is presented here was posed by a technical 
library with limited bubget and personnel.  The solution,
however, is quite general and is applicable 
to many different types of retrieval problems.  Further,the
method of solution makes it possible for 
many groups who have previously dismissed an information
retrieval program as expensive and difficult 
(from a programming stand-point) to reconsider their position,
for the present solution makes it possible 
to install an information retrieval program in less than
three months, and with relatively little equipment.
