Symbolic Execution and Program Testing

This paper describes the symbolic execution of
programs.  Instead of supplying the normal inputs 
to a program (e.g. numbers) one supplies symbols representing
arbitrary values.  The execution proceeds 
as in a normal execution except that values may be symbolic
formulas over the input symbols.  The difficult, 
yet interesting issues arise during the symbolic execution
of conditional branch type statements.  A 
particular system called EFFIGY which provides symbolic
execution for program testing and debugging is 
also described.  It interpretively executes programs written
in a simple PL/I style programming language. 
 It includes many standard debugging features, the ability
to manage and to prove things about symbolic 
expressions, a simple program testing manager, and a program
verifier.  A brief discussion of the relationship 
between symbolic execution and program proving is also included.
