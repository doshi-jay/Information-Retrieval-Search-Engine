CURRICULUM 68 -- Recommendations for Academic
Programs in Computer Science -- A Report of the 
ACM Curriculum Committee on Computer science

This report contains recommendations on academic
programs in computer science which were developed 
by the ACM Curriculum Committee on Computer Science.
 A classification of the subject areas contained 
in computer science is presented and twenty-two courses
in these areas are described.  Prerequisites, 
catalog descriptions, detailed outlines, and annotated
bibliographies for these courses are included. 
 Specific recommendations which have evolved from the
Committee's 1965 Preliminary Recommendations are 
given for undergraduate programs.  Graduate programs in computer
science are discussed and some recommendations 
are presented for the development of master's degree programs.
 Ways of developing guidelines for doctoral 
programs are discussed, but no specific recommendations
are made. The importance of service courses, 
minors, and continuing education in computer science is
emphasized.  Attention is given to the organization, 
staff requirements, computer resources, and other facilities
needed to implement computer science educational 
programs.
