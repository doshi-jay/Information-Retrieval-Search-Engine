Automatic Abstracting and Indexing Survey and Recommendations

In preparation for the widespread use of automatic
scanners which will read documents and transmit 
their contents to other machines for analysis, this report
presents a new concept in automatic analysis: 
the relative-frequency approach to measuring  the significance
of words, word groups, and sentences. 
 The relative-frequency approach is discussed in detail,
as is its application to problems of automatic 
indexing and automatic abstracting.  Included in the
report is a summary of automatic analysis studies 
published as of the date of writing.  Conclusions are
that point toward more sophisticated mathematical 
and linguistic techniques for the solution of problems of automatic analysis.
