Applications of Binary Numbers In Computer Routines

A binary number can be thought of as an alternate
form of expression for either a set of letters 
or a decimal number.  There are then three equivalent
expressions, easily translatable to one another, 
each having different characteristics.  Four examples
are given in which the form of an expression is 
changed to an equivalent expression to save space or gain power.
