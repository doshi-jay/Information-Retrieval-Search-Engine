Coding the Lehmer Pseudo-random Number Generator

An algorithm and coding technique is presented
for quick evaluation of the Lehmer pseudo-random 
number generator modulo 2**31 - 1, a prime Mersenne
number with produces 2**31 - 2 numbers, on a p-bit 
(greater than 31) computer.  The computation method is
extendible to limited problems in modular arithmetic. 
 Prime factorization for 2**61 - 2 and a primitive root
for 2**61 - 1, the next largest prime Mersenne 
number, are given for possible construction of a pseudo-random
number generator of increased cycle length.
