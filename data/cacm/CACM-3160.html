Rejuvenating Experimental Computer Science

This report is based on the results of an NSF sponsored
workshop held in Wasington, D. on November 2, 1978.  The co-authors of the 
report are: Gordon Bell, Digital Equipment Corporation; Bernard A. Galler,
University of Michigan; Patricia Goldberg, IBM Corporation; John
Hamblen, University of Missouri at Rolla; Elliot Pinson, Bell Telephone
Laboratories; and Ivan Sutherland, California Institute of
Technology.  Also participating in the workshop were representatives
of NSF and other government agencies.  In addition to the authors,
a number of other people have contributed to the contents of this
report.  In preparation for the original workshop, all doctorate-granting 
computer science departments in the nation were asked
for comments and suggestions on the problems of experimental computer science.
A version of the current report dated January 15 was circulated to these 
departments and to a number of industrial and government groups for criticism.
The editors and authors of this final version gratefully acknowledge the 
contribution of a large number of other people at all stages in the preparation 
of the report.
$Note: Following this presentation of the report, there is a
position paper on the crisis in experimental computer
science written by the ACM Executive Committee.)
