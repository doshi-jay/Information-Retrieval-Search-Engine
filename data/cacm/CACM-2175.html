Subexpression Ordering in the Execution of Arithmetic Expressions

An arithmetic expression can often be broken
down into its component subexpressions.  Depending 
on the hardware environment in which the expression is
to be executed, these subexpressions can be evaluated 
in serials, in parallel, or in a combination of these
modes.  This paper shows that expression execution 
time can be minimized only if consideration is given to
the ordering of the subexpressions.  In particular, 
subexpressions should be executed in order of decreasing
memory and processor time requirements.  This 
observation is valid for configurations ranging from
a uniprocessor with an unbuffered main memory to 
multiprocessor with a "cache" buffer memory.  If the
number of subexpressions which can be executed in 
parallel exceeds the number of available processors,
then execution of some of these subexpressions must 
be postponed.  A procedure is given which combines this
requirement with the earlier ordering considerations 
to provide an optimal execution sequence.
