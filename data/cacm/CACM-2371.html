A System for Interprocess Communication
in a Resource Sharing Computer Network

A system of communication between processes in a
time-sharing system is described and the communication 
system is extended so that it may be used between processes
distributed throughout a computer network. 
 The hypothetical application of the system to an existing network is discussed.
