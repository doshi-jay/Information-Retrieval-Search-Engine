A Computer System for Inference Execution and Data Retrieval

This paper presents a RAND project concerned
with the use of computers as assistants in the 
logical analysis of large collections of factual data.
 A system called Relational Data File was developed 
for this purpose.  The Relational Data File is briefly
detailed and problems arising from its implementation 
are discussed.
