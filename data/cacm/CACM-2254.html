Dynamic Partitioning for Array Languages

The classical process of partitioning an array
into subarrays is extended to a more useful 
array language operation.  Various modes of partitioning
are defined for different types of arrays, so 
that subarrays may vary over the original array in
a nearly arbitrary manner.  These definitions are 
motivated with several realistic examples to illustrate
the value of partitioning for array languages. 
 Of general interest is the data structure for partitioning.
 This consists of dynamic tree structures 
which are used to derive and maintain the array control
information.  These are described in sufficient 
detail to be of value in the design of other array languages.
 The description presented in this paper 
is implemented in a new array language, OL/2, currently
under development at the University of Illinois.
