Production Systems: or Can We Do Better than BNF?

Since the development of BNF, the definition
of the syntax of programming languages has been 
almost universally associated with context-free requirements.
 Yet numerous interesting and difficult 
issues in syntax stem from the context-sensitive requirements,
notably the compatibility between the 
declaration of an identifier and its uses, the correspondence
between actual and formal parameters, and 
issues arising from block structure.  This paper explores
the use of a formal notation called Production 
Systems in providing a readable and complete formal definition
of syntax.  As a practical illustration, 
a small but significant subset of PL/I is considered.  A
more detailed presentation, as well as the application 
to define abstract syntax and translations between languages,
is given in a previous paper by the author.
