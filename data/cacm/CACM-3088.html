General Equations for Idealized CPU-I/O Overlap Configurations

General equations are derived for estimating
the maximum possible utilization of main storage 
partitions, CPU and I/O devices under different conditions
in an idealized CPU-I/O overlap model of multiprogrammed 
computer systems.  The equations are directly applicable
to any configuration consisting  of sets of 
identical CPU's I/O processors, main storage partitions
and user tasks.  Examples are provided to illustrate 
the use of the equations to compute effective processing
time per record and expected timesharing response 
time under both balanced and unbalanced resource utilization conditions.
