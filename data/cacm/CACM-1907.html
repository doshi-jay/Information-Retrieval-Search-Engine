A Note on Reliable Full-Duplex Transmission over Half-Duplex Links

A simple procedure for achieving reliable full-duplex
transmission over half-duplex links is 
proposed. The scheme is compared with another of the
same type, which has recently been described in 
the literature.  Finally, some comments are made on
another group of related transmission procedures 
which have been shown to be unreliable under some circumstances.
