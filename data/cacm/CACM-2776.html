Computer Networks in Higher Education: Socio-Economic-Political Factors

This study presents the results of a nationwide
survey of computer networks in higher education 
conducted during 1971-73.  Five major and 18 minor networks
were identified.  The five major networks 
included: the ARPA Net, the California State College network,
the University of Iowa/Iowa State University 
network, the Michigan Educational Research Information Triad,
Inc., and the Triangle Universities Computation 
Center network in North Carolina. In-depth studies were
conducted of the latter two nets.  Based on the 
experiences of these operating networks, a number of factors
are identified for consideration in developing 
networks.  Finally, recommendations are advanced regarding
the development of networks in higher education 
in the future.
