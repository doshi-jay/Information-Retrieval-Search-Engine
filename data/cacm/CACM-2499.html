Efficient Multiprogramming Resource Allocation and Accounting

Although sometimes thought of as only a component
of time-sharing operation, multiprogramming 
can involve broader questions of resource allocation,
since fairness is not required to meet a response 
criterion.  In a multiprogrammed system, it may serve
maximal resource use to be unfair, for example 
by holding an input/output channel idle for a program
while it completes a small amount of processor 
usage, enabling further use of the channel.  Several
applications of this principle are given, and it 
is suggested that a multiprogramming executive might
dynamically adjust its allocation algorithms to 
gain efficiency.  Allocation of resources is closely connected
to accounting for those resources, raising 
the problems of repeatability, minimal uncharged overhead,
and relative weighting of charges for dependent 
resources.  Since weightings may depend on allocation
algorithms, these are not arbitrary accounting 
parameters.  Often the only repeatable accounting is
one which omits an extensive overhead will be paid, 
and should multiprogramming prove efficient, overcharges
will result.  Multiprogramming turns on allocation 
of the memory resource essential to control of other
resources.  The general suggestions for allocation 
and accounting are applied to this question, and some
details provided for the case of a monitor which 
controls a virtual-memory machine.
