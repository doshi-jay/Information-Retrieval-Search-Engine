An Assembly Language for Reprogramming

Complete reprogramming of compiler language programs
is seldom necessary.  It is assembly language 
programs which present the greatest difficulty.  Assembly
languages generally provide a one-for-one translation 
from a symbolic to a numeric version of a program, that
is, from assembly language to machine language. 
 The meta-language presented here can be used to specify
the mapping of any language which conforms to 
a canonical list form into an arbitrary stream of bits.
 This bit stream may be treated as a machine 
language program, a character stream, or whatever else
the user might desire.  Thus, this meta-language 
can be used to map from one assembly language into another
or from the assembly language for one machine 
into the machine language of another.
