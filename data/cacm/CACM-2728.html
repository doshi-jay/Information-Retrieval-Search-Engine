Consecutive Storage of Relevant Records with Redundancy

This paper studies the properties of a new
class of file organizations (CRWR) where records 
relevant to every query are stored in consecutive storage
locations but the organizations contain redundancy. 
Some theorems which provide tools for reducing redundancy
in CRWR organizations have been also developed. 
Redundancies obtained by the application of these theorems
are compared with that of query-inverted file 
organizations.  Some CRWR organization with minimum redundancy
have also been developed for queries which 
specify sets of keys.
