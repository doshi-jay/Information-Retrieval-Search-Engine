Some Ideas on Data Types in High-Level Languages

A number of issues are explored concerning the
notion that a data type is a set of values together 
with a set of primitive operations on those values.  Among
these are the need for a notation for iterating 
over the elements of any finite set (instead of the
more narrow for i:= 1 to n notation), the use of 
the domain of an array as a data type, the need for
a simple notation for allowing types of parameters 
to be themselves parameters (but in a restrictive fashion),
and resulting problems with conversion of 
values from one type to another.
