A Fast Algorithm for Computing Longest Common Subsequences

Previously published algorithms for finding
the longest common subsequence of two sequences 
of length n have had a best-case running time of O(n^2).
 An algorithm for this problem is presented 
which has a running time of O((r + n)log n), where r
is the total number of ordered pairs of positions 
at which the two sequences match.  Thus in the worst
case the algorithm has a running time of O(n^2 log 
n).  However, for those applications where most positions
of one sequence match relatively few positions 
in the other sequence, a running time of O(n log n) can be expected.
