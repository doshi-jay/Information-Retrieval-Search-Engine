A Man-Machine Approach Toward Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem

The traveling salesman problem belongs to an
important class of scheduling and routing problems. 
 It is also a subproblem in solving others, such as
the warehouse distribution problem.  It has been 
attacked by many mathematical methods with but meager
success.  Only for special forms of the problem 
or for problems with a moderate number of points can
it be solved exactly, even if very large amounts 
of computer time are used.  Heuristic procedures have
been proposed and tested with only slightly better 
results.  This paper describes a computer aided heuristic
technique which uses only a modest amount of 
computer time in real-time to solve large (100-200)
point problems.  This technique takes advantage of 
both the computer's and the human's problem-solving
abilities.  The computer is not asked to solve the 
problem in a brute force way as in many of today's heuristics,
but it is asked to organize the data for 
the human so that the human can solve the problem easily.
 The technique used in this paper seems to 
point to new directions in the field of man-machine interaction
and in the field of artificial intelligence.
