An Analysis of Algorithms for the Dutch National Flag Problem

Solutions to the Dutch National Flag Problem
have been given by Dijkstra [1] and Meyer [3]. 
 Dijkstra starts with a simple program and arrives at
an improved program by refinement.  Both of the 
algorithms given by Dijkstra are shown to have an expected number
of swaps which is 2/3N + 0(1) and that 
these values differ at most by 1/3 of a swap and asymptotically
by 1/4 of a swap.  The algorithm of Meyer 
is shown to have expected swap complexity 5/9N.
