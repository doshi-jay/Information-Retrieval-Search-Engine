A New Method for the Solution of the
Cauchy Problem for Parabolic Equations

An integral equation representation is given
for parabolic partial differential equations. 
 When the equations are defined in unbounded domains, as
in the initial value (Cauchy) problem, the solution 
of the integral equation by the method of successive
approximation has inherent advantages over other 
methods.  Error bounds for the methods are of order h^(3/2)
and h^(7/2) (his the increment size) depending 
on the finite difference approximations involved.
