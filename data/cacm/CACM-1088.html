Menu Planning by Computer

A computer code has been developed which plans
menus by finding minimum cost combinations of 
menu items such that the daily dietary, gastronomic
and production requirements can be satisfied for 
a sequence of days.  A fast, special integer programming
algorithm is described which approximates the 
theoretical solution to the problem.  If necessary, any
menu can be changed on-line and then post-optimized. 
 Up to 30 percent saving on food cost is possible. 
A FORTRAN program for the IBM 1410 is available on 
request.  A considerable amount of data processing
must precede the implementation of the system.
