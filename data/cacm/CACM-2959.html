The System for Business Automation (SBA): Programming Language

The system for business automation (SBA) is a system
within which application experts-nonprogrammers-can 
describe and execute their applications on a computer. 
The user of SBA views his application as manipulation 
of information in two-dimensional pictures of tables,
business forms, and reports on a display terminal. 
 He can gradually automate this application by giving "examples"
to the system of how he manually manipulates 
the information.  The Query-by-Example database language
is a subset of the SBA programming language.
