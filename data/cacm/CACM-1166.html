A Use of Macros in Translation of Symbolic
Assembly Language of One Computer to Another

A set of macro-operations has been prepared
to assist in translating IBM 7090 symbolic assembly 
language programs to IBM 7040 machine language programs.
 This set, inserted at the beginning of the 
7090 symbolic deck, treats incompatible instruction mnemonics
as macro-instructions to produce equivalent 
7040 instruction sets.  Incompatible instructions are
categorized into basic operational classes which 
can be expressed by a single basic skeleton.  Several levels
of macro calls are required to supply arguments 
to the basic skeleton for each particular instruction.
 Modification at execution time of the address 
or tag of an incompatible instruction requires incorporation
of an address-tag equivalent.  I/O is handled 
by generating calls to I/O simulation subroutines.
