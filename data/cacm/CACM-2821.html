Cobol Under Control

A sample set of Cobol programming standards
is offered.  These standards constrain code to 
be developed in a "structured" form for both data and
control structures.  They do not require syntax 
beyond the existing Cobol language and in fact utilize
a typical limited subset of the 1974 ANS Cobol 
standard.  These standards have proved extremely valuable
in practice and have reduced the cost and time 
to produce and maintain large software systems that have
been deployed in live multiple customer environments.
