Computer-Drawn Flowcharts*

To meet the need for improved documentation
of written computer programs, a simple system for 
effective communication is presented, which has shown
great promise.  The programmer describes his program 
in a simple format, and the computer prepares flow charts
and other cross-referenced listings from this 
input.  The description can be kept up-to-date easily,
and the final output clearly explains the original 
program.  The system has also proved to be a valuable debugging and coding aid.
