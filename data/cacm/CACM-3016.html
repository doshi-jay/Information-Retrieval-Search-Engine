A Comparison of Numerical Techniques in Markov Modeling

This paper presents several numerical methods which
may be used to obtain the stationary probability 
vectors of Markovian models.  An example of a nearly
decomposable system is considered, and the results 
obtained by the different methods examined.  A post
mortem reveals why standard techniques often fail 
to yield the correct results.  Finally, a means of estimating
the error inherent in the decomposition 
of certain models is presented.
