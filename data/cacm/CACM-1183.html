A Note on the Use of a Digital Computer
for Doing Tedious Algebra and Programming

A special purpose compiler was written with
FORTRAN II language and made possible the writing 
of very long programs by the computer.  The procedure is
based on a straight-forward use of FORMAT statements 
for generating machine-written programs.
