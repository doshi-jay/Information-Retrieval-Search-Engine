An Approach to the Optimum Design of Computer Graphics Systems

Display system designers are faced with the
difficult task of selecting major subsystems in 
an intelligent way.  Each subsystem is chosen from large
numbers of alternatives; the selection is based 
on considerations such as system response time, system
cost, and the distribution of data storage and 
processing between the graphics processor and its supporting
data processing system.  The work reported 
here develops an objective, quantitative design procedure
and helps give a better understanding of now 
to  configure display systems.  This is accomplished by
means of a mathematical model of a computer driven 
graphics system.  The parameters of the model are functions
of the capabilities of the graphics hardware 
and of the computational requirements of the graphics application.
 The model can be analyzed using numerical 
queueing analysis or simulation to obtain an average
response time prediction.  By combining the model 
with an optimization, the best graphics system configuration,
subject to a cost constraint, is found 
for several applications.  The optimum configurations
are in turn used to find general display system 
design guidelines.
