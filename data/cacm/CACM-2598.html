Extending the Information Theory Approach to Converting
Limited-Entry Decision Tables to Computer 
Programs

This paper modifies an earlier algorithm for
converting decision tables into flowcharts which 
minimize subsequent execution time when compiled into
a computer program.  The algorithms considered 
in this paper perform limited search and, accordingly,
do not necessarily result in globally optimal 
solutions.  However, the greater search effort needed
to obtain a globally optimal solution for complex 
decision tables is usually not justified by sufficient
savings in execution time.  There is an analogy 
between the problem of converting decision tables into
efficient flowcharts and the well-understood problem 
in information theory of noiseless coding.  The results
of the noiseless coding literature are used to 
explore the limitations of algorithms used to solve
the decision table problem.  The analogy between 
the two problems is also used to develop improvements
to the information algorithm in extending the depth 
of search under certain conditions and in proposing
additional conditions to be added to the decision 
table.  Finally, the information algorithm is compared
with an algorithm proposed in a recent paper by 
Verhelst.
