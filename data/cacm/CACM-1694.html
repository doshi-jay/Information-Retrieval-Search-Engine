An Algorithm for the Probability of
the Union of a Large Number of Events

An algorithm is presented which efficiently evaluates
the probability for the union of n independent 
and not mutually exclusive events. The problem is that
of evaluating the sums of the products of all 
possible combinations of n variables in minimum time and storage space.
