An Extension of the Munkres Algorithm for
the Assignment Problem to Rectangular Matrices

The assignment problem, together with Munkres
proposed algorithm for its solution in square 
matrices, is presented first.  Then the authors develop
an extension of this algorithm which permits 
a solution for rectangular matrices.  Timing results
obtained by using an adapted version of Silver's 
Algol procedure are discussed, and a relation between
solution time and problem size is given.
