Dynamic Microprogramming: Processor Organization and Programming

A dynamically microprogrammed processor is characterized
by a small (4^k 64-bit word) read-write 
"micro" storage.  The access time of this storage is
similar to the cycle time of the machine (50-100 
nsec).  This microstorage is used to contain both data
and subroutines.  The (micro) instructions in 
such a processor differ from the conventional in that
they perform only purely combinatorial operations; 
sequencing is under the control of the microinstruction.
The presence of the read-write microstorage 
permits a more flexible assignment of resources than the
read-only storage.  In particular, the processor 
developed in this paper stresses the simultaneous operation
(within the microinstruction) of the adder, 
shifter, masker, and testing facilities of the processor.
 A microassembly language is developed and 
the overhead involved in subroutine linkages is analyzed.
 The efficiency of a flexible software linkage 
scheme is examined as to its overhead for various subroutine
characteristics.  Finally, three examples 
of problem-oriented programming are considered and the
resulting coding is compared against a System/360 
assembly language version, with the technology normalized.
