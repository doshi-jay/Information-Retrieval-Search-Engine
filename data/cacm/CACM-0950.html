Parallel Methods for Integrating Ordinary Differential Equations

This paper is dedicated to the proposition that,
in order to take full advantage for real-time 
computations of highly parallel computers as can be
expected to be available in the near future, much 
of numerical analysis will have to be recast in a more
"parallel" form.  By this is meant that serial 
algorithms ought to be replaced by algorithm which
consist of several subtasks which can be computed 
without knowledge of the results of the other subtasks. 
As an example, a method is proposed for "parallelizing" 
the numerical integration of an ordinary differential
equation, which process, by all standard methods, 
is entirely serial.
