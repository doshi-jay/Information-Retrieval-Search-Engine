Methods of Numerical Integration Applied to
a System Having Trivial Function Evaluations

A study has been made to determine which methods
of numerical integration require the least 
computation time for a given amount of truncation error
when applied to a particular system of ordinary 
differential equations where function evaluations are
relatively trivial.  Recent methods due to Butcher 
and Gear are compared with classic Runge-Kutta, Kutta-Nystrom
and Adams methods.  Some of the newer one-step 
methods due to Butcher are found to be slightly superior,
but no one method is found to have any great 
advantage over the others in the application to this particular problem.
