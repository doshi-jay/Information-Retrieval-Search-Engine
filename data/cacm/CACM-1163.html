Philco/IBM Translation at Problem-Oriented, Symbolic and Binary Levels

A translation system has been developed to
eliminate most of the effort formerly required to 
reprogram Philco 2000 series codes for IBM 7094 operation.
 Experience with this system is limited but 
highly successful encouraging application of the
techniques to other source and object languages.
