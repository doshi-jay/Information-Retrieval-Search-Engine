An Optimal Real-Time Algorithm for Planar Convex Hulls

An algorithm is described for the construction in real-time of the
convex hull of a set of n points in the plane.   Using an appropriate data
structure, the algorithm constructs the convex hull by successive
updates, each taking time O(log n), thereby achieving a total
processing time O(n log n).
