Hidden Lines Elimination for a Rotating Object

A method is presented of determining which
parts of three-dimensional objects are visible and 
which are invisible when the objects are rotated about
some axis.  This paper describes a polygon comparison 
scheme in which the relationships of two polygons can
be classified into tree types, and also discusses 
how the relationship is changed for each pair of polygons
under rotation about some axis.  A rotation 
table is defined for each pair of polygons, which remains
fixed as long as rotation is about one axis 
and provides a means of rapidly determining the visible
and hidden line relationship between two polygons. 
 Additional work must be done to extend this approach
to simultaneous rotation about several axes.
