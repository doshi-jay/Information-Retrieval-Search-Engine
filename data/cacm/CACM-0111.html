On Programming the Numerical Solution of Polynomial Equations

Numerical techniques are presented for computing
the roots of polynomial equations.  By applying 
the recommended scaling and inversion rules, the basic
Bairstow and Newton-Raphson iterative techniques 
can be applied with great reliability.  Both a high degree
of accuracy and rapid convergence are realized. 
 Numerical examples are shown to illustrate the pitfalls
and to show how these are circumvented by application 
of the recommended procedures.
