A Modified Inversion Procedure for Product
Form of the Inverse Linear Programming Codes

This paper describes a new algorithm for the
selection of the pivot row in matrix inversion 
when using the product form of the inverse.  This algorithm
has been developed for linear programming 
codes; however, it would be valuable for the inversion
of any non-dense matrix.  The procedures described 
in this paper have been thoroughly tested and have been
in operation on the Esso Research and Engineering 
IBM 7090 computer for nine months.  Substantial computer
cost savings have been realized because of this 
procedure.
