Incorporation of Units into Programming Languages

The issues of how a programming language might
aid in keeping track of physical units (feet, 
sec, etc.) are discussed.  A method is given for the
introduction of relationships among units (a watt 
is volts*amps, a yard is three feet) and subsequent automatic
conversion based upon these relationships.
 Various proposals for syntax are considered.
