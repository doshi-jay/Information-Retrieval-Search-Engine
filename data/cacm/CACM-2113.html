The Multistore Parser for Hierarchical Syntactic Structures

A syntactic parser is described for hierarchical concatenation patterns
that are presented to the analyzer in the form of linear strings.  Particular
emphasis is given to the system of "significant addresses" by means
of which processing times for large-scale matching procedures
can be substantially reduced.  The description makes frequent use
of examples taken from the fully operational implementation of the
parser in an experimental English sentence analyzer.  By structuring
an area of the computer's central core storage in such a way
that the individual locations of bytes and bits come to represent the
data involved in the matching procedure, the shifting of information
is reduced to a minimum, and the searching of lists is eliminated
altogether.  The matches are traced by means of binary masks
and the state of single bits determines the operational flow of the
procedure.  The method could be implemented with any interpretive
grammar, provided it can be expressed by the functional classification
of the items composing the input hierarchical structures.
