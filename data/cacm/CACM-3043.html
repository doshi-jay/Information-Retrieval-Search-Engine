Distributed Processes: A Concurrent Programming Concept

A language concept for concurrent processes
without common variables is introduced.  These 
processes communicate and synchronize by means of procedure
calls and guarded regions.  This concept 
is proposed for real-time applications controlled by
microcomputer networks with distributed storage. 
 The paper gives several examples of distributed processes
and shows that they include procedures, coroutines, 
classes, monitors, processes, semaphores, buffers, path
expressions, and input/output as special cases.
