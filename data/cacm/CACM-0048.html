Shift-Register Code for Indexing Applications

In this communication the use of a shift-register
code with n = 10 is described for calling 
64 wireless telemetering stations in a fixed cyclical order.
 A high degree of redundancy is used, permitting 
a single-error correcting code ("minimum-distance-three"
code) with 64 10-bit code words to be employed 
as the station identification code.  Embedding this in
the shift-register code with period 1023 permits 
the code to be employed without punctuation, each of
the telemetering station receivers simply putting 
received ones and zeros into a shift register.  Each
time the given code combination arises identifying 
the particular station (barring for tuitous error combinations
of very low probability) it has been called. 
 The communication describes the properties and application
of the code in some detail and the finding 
of the particular example to be employed on URAL, the
Soviet-built drum computer donated to the Indian 
Statistical Institute by the United Nations
Technical Aid Administration (UNTAA).
