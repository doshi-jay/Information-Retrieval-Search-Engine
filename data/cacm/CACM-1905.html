The Simplex Method of Linear Programming Using LU Decomposition

Standard computer implementations of Dantzig's
simplex method for linear programming are based 
upon forming the inverse of the basic matrix and updating
the inverse after every step of the method. 
 These implementations have bad round-off error properties.
 This paper gives the theoretical background 
for an implementation which is based upon the LU decomposition,
computed with row interchanges, of the 
basic matrix.  The implementation is slow, but has good
round-off error behavior.  The implementation 
appears as CACM Algorithm 350.
