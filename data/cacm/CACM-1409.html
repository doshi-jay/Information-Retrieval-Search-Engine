NEBULA: A Digital Computer Using a 20 Mc Glass Delay Line Memory

Oregon State University has designed and constructed
a medium-speed serial digital computer 
using glass delay lines circulating at 22 Mc as memory.
 The design objectives as originally conceived 
in a special seminar were: (1) to be a research project
in computer design; (2) to be usable as an educational 
machine;and (3) to have easily modifiable hardware for
basic research in computer systems design.  An 
unusual arrangement of information within the 22 Mc
memory allows a simple interface with the 340 Kc 
arithmetic unit, which results in an effective zero latency
time and provides possibilities for an associative 
memory.  The arithmetic unit has a command structure similar
to large parallel machines, and uses flip-flop 
arithmetic and control registers throughout.  All hardware
development has been aimed toward the concept 
of easy modification, elaborate console controls for
effective man-machine interaction and low cost.
