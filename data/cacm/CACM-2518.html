Programming by Questionnaire: An Effective Way To Use Decision Tables

Programming by questionnaire combines aspects
of decision table programming and general purpose 
programming by using decision tables to construct an application
program through the selection of certain 
source statements from a predefined file.  It is proposed
that programming by questionnairies a useful 
compromise between general and special purpose programming
for a significant class of large scale problems. 
 The elements of the approach are discussed
an existing application is described.
