Systems Design Education: A Gaming Approach

One of the problems facing managers of computer
installations is the problem of configuring 
the computer system to meet the demands made by the
mix of jobs that the computer center must service. 
 This paper presents a management game that allows
the player to configure a computer system to meet 
a hypothetical job mix is under the control of a game administrator
and can be varied to simulate a variety 
of real-world situations (I/O bound jobs, compute bound
jobs, etc.).  The player of the game receives 
a set of detailed reports on the cost of his choices
and a simulated run of the center operating under 
his choices.
