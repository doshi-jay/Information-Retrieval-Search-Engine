Trace-Driven Modeling and Analysis of
CPU Scheduling in Multiprogramming System

Microscopic level job stream data obtained in
a production environment by an event-driven software 
probe is used to drive a model of a multiprogramming
computer system.  The CPU scheduling algorithm of 
the model is systematically varied.  This technique,
called trace-driven modeling, provides an accurate 
replica of a production environment for the testing of variations
in the system.  At the same time alterations 
in scheduling methods can be easily carried out in a
controlled way with cause and effects relationships 
being isolated.  The scheduling methods tested included
the best possible and worst possible methods, 
the traditional methods of multiprogramming theory, round-robin,
first-come-first-served, etc., and dynamic 
predictors.  The relative and absolute performances of
these scheduling methods are given.  It is concluded 
that a successful CPU scheduling method must be preemptive
and must prevent a given job from holding 
the CPU for too long a period.
