An Algorithm for Reduction of Operator Strength

A simple algorithm which uses an indexed temporary
table to perform reduction of operator strength 
in strongly connected regions is presented.  Several extensions,
including linear function test replacement, 
are discussed.  These algorithms should fit well into an
integrated package of local optimization algorithms.
