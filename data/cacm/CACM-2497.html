Synchronizing Processors with Memory-Content-Generated Interrupts

Implementations of the "Lock-Unlock" method
of synchronizing processors in a multiprocessor 
system usually require uninterruptable, memory-pause type instructions.
 An interlock scheme called read-interlock, 
which does not require memory-pause instructions, has
been developed for a dual DEC PDP-10 system with 
real-time requirements.  The read-interlock method does
require a special"read-interlock" instruction 
in the repertoire of the processors and a special "read-interlock"
cycle in the repertoire of the memory 
modules.  When a processor examines a "lock" (a memory
location) with a read-interlock instruction, it 
will be interrupted if the lock was already set; examining
a lock immediately sets it if it was not already 
set (this event sequence is a read-interlock cycle). 
Writing into a lock clears it.  Having the processor 
interrupted upon encountering a set lock instead of
branching is advantageous if the branch would have 
resulted in an effective interrupt.
