On the Computer Enumeration of Finite Topologies

The problem of enumerating the number of topologies
which can be formed from a finite point 
set is considered both theoretically and computationally.
 Certain fundamental results are established, 
leading to an algorithm for enumerating finite topologies,
and computed results are given for n <= 7. 
 An interesting side result of the computational work
was the unearthing of a theoretical error which 
had been induced into the literature; the use of the computer
in combinatorics represents, chronologically, 
an early application, and this side result underscores
its continuing usefulness in this area.
