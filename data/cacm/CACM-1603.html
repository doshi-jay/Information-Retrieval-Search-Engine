A Multiprogramming Monitor for Small Machines

INT, a combination hardware/software monitor
designed to control a wide variety of real-time 
input/output devices, is described.  The simple hardware
additions provide a uniform device to machine 
interface for such elements as keyboards graphic input
devices, and interval timers.  The software relieves 
the user program from the details of input/output timing,
buffering, and task scheduling and provides 
parallel processing capability.  User programs communicate
with the monitor through a small set of meta-instruction 
which consists mostly of machine-language subroutine calls.
