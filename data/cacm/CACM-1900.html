Clarification of Fortran Standards-Initial Progress

In 1966 after four years of effort, FORTRAN
became the first programming language standardized 
in the United States.  Since that initial achievement,
study and application of the standard specifications 
have revealed the need for maintenance of the standards.
 As the result of work initiated in 1967, an 
initial set of clarifying interpretations has been prepared.
 The nature of the maintenance, corrections 
to the standard specifications, and completed interpretations are reported.
