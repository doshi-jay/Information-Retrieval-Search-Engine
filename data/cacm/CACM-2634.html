An Evaluation of Statistical Software in the Social Sciences 

Several hundred college and university computer
installations now offer various types of statistical 
packages for general use.  Among those most widely available
are OSIRIS, SPSS, BMD, DATA-TEXT, and TSAR. 
 In order to provide users with a basis for selection
and use, tests were made for each of these systems, 
and the results are summarized as to cost and performance.
