On the Expected Gain From Adjust ing Matched Term Retrieval Systems

A file adjustment procedure based on maximizing
the Bayes expected gain proposed for matched 
term retrieval systems.  The expected gain and its probability
distribution are derived as a function 
of: (1) the prior proportion of omitted terms, and (2) the
coefficient of separation between two distributions 
corresponding to values of an adjustment statistic.  An
example evaluates the gain parameters for a typical 
information retrieval system.
