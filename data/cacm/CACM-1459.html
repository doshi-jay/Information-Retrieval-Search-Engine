Requirements for Real-Time Languages

Real-time languages have different requirements
from other programming languages because of 
the special nature of their applications, the environment
in which their object programs are executed 
and the environment in which they may be compiled.  It
may not be the language extensions that ultimately 
advance developments in the field.  Progress may be made
by attacking the special compiling and executing 
system problems that must be solved.
