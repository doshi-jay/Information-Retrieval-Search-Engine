On Shrinking Binary Picture Patterns

A parallel processing algorithm for shrinking
binary patterns to obtain single isolated elements, 
one for each pattern, is presented.  This procedure
may be used for counting patterns on a matrix, and 
a hardware implementation of the algorithm using large
scale integrated technology is envisioned.  The 
principal features of this method are the very small
window employed (two-by-two elements), the parallel 
nature of the process, and the possibility of shrinking
any pattern, regardless of the complexity of 
its configuration.  Problems regarding merging and disconnection
of patterns during the process as well 
as the determination of the maximum number of steps
necessary to obtain a single isolated element from 
a pattern, are reviewed and discussed.  An analogy with a
neural network description, in terms of McCulloch-Pitts 
"neurons" is presented.
