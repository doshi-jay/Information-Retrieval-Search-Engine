   A FORMAC Program for the Solution of Linear Boundary and Initial Value 
Problems

  A computer program is described which has been developed for obtaining
approximate solutions to linear initial and boundary-value problems involving 
differential equations. For each problem, input to the program includes:
   1. The equations (in symbolic form) to be satisfied  -  the differential
equations, equations describing auxiliary conditions such as boundary 
conditions, etc.
   2. A numerical description of the regions in which each of the equations
are to be satisfied.
   3. Sets of functions (in symbolic form) to be used in linear combinations
to approximate the solution functions. Give the above input, the program
generates an approximation to the solutions of the specified problemm in terms 
of the specified functions which is optimum in the least-squares sense.
