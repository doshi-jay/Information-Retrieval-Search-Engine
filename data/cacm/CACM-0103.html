COPE (Console Operator Proficiency Examination)*

Each year electronic computers become more
sophisticated, and the programs they must process 
become more complex.  Because of this,dependence of
those in computing on the skill and experience of 
operators is increasing.  At the same time, selection
and training of qualified operators grows more 
difficult.  To meet the need for a quick, accurate, uniform
operator test and training aid, the authors 
have developed COPE (Console Operator Proficiency Examination),
outlined below.  While this examination 
is programmed specifically for the IBM 705 Model II with
two Tape Record Coordinators, similar programs 
could be developed for other computers.
