The Performance of a System for Automatic Segmentation
of Programs Within an ALGOL Compiler (GIER 
ALGOL)

The GIER ALGOL compiler makes use of an automatic
system for handling the transfers of program 
segments from the drum store to the core store at program
execution time.  The logic of this system is 
described. The performance of the system is discussed,
primarily on the basis of execution times related 
to two specific programs.  This discussion concludes with
an assessment of the potential gains of various 
ways of improving the system.
