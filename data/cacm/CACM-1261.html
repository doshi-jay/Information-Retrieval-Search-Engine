Modeling and Simulation of Digital Networks

The simulation of digital networks on a digital
computer provides the engineer with an effective 
means of analyzing time-quantized logical behavior.  The
digital network is modeled as a set of time-dependent 
or time-independent Boolean transformations; each transformation
describing the input-output relationship 
of a model element comprising the network mode.  The
simplicity of utilizing the FORTRAN IV Programming 
System as a digital Network Simulator is discussed an
illustrated.  This simplicity is derived from a 
common modeling technique applicable to combinational
and sequential digital networks and a systematic 
programming approach.
