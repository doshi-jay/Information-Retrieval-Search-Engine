The Distribution of a Program in Primary and Fast Buffer Storage

A virtual memory computer system with a fast
buffer (cache) memory between primary memory and 
the central processing unit is considered.  The optimal
distribution of a program between the buffer 
and primary memory is studied using the program's lifetime
function.  Expressions for the distribution 
of a program which maximizes the useful fraction of
the cost-time integral of primary and fast buffer 
storage are obtained for swapping and nonswapping buffer management policies.
