Considerations for Future Programming Language Standards Activities

This paper reviews the current state of programming
language standards activities with respect 
to the anomalies which exist between the various published
and proposed standards for Fortran, Cobol, 
PL/I, and Basic.  Proposals are made for the inclusion
of formalisms within future standards and the 
extension of the standards to include additional items
such as error conditions and documentation.
