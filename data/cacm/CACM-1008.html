Scheduling Meetings with a Computer

Computer scheduling of papers as it was developed
for the 1960 meeting of the Federation of 
American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) is described.
 The FASEB meeting is the largest scientific 
meeting held in the United States each year.  The technique
developed for FASEB can be applied to schedule 
any meeting with parallel sessions.
