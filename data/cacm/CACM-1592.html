String Similarity and Misspellings

The problem of programming a computer to determine
whether or not a string of characters is 
a misspelling of a given word was considered.  A numberof
algorithms were evaluated-some proposed by 
other writers, some by the author.  These techniques
were tested on a collection of misspellings made 
by students at various grade levels.  While many of
the methods were clearly unsatisfactory, some gave 
as few as 2.1 percent incorrect determinations.
