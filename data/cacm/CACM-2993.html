Occurrences of Cycling and Other Phenomena
Arising in a Class of Linear Programming Models

An investigation into the average queue size
for a certain class of queues has resulted in 
the formulation of linear programming problems which
are ill-conditioned in some cases.  In attempting 
to solve these linear programming models, using IBM's
MPS package, instances of cycling were encountered. 
 Small perturbations in the input data resulted in problems
which did not cycle.  This fact, plus several 
other observed phenomena suggest that the primary reason
that cycling is not known to occur more frequently 
is the round-off errors in the computations perturb
the problem sufficiently to prevent cycling (or at 
least to prevent indefinite cycling).  In one case maximizing
and minimizing an objective function subject 
to the same constrain t set was attempted, but MPS solved
only one of these while giving an indication 
of infeasibility for the other.
