Semantic Evaluation from Left to Right

This paper describes attribute grammars and their
use for the definition of programming languages 
and compilers; a formal definition of attribute grammars
and a discussion of some of its important aspects 
are included. The paper concentrates on the evaluation
of semantic attributes in a few passes from left 
to right over the derivation tree of a program.  A
condition for an attribute grammar is given which 
assures that the semantics of any program can be evaluated
in a single pass over the derivation tree, 
and an algorithm is discussed which decides how many
passes from left to right are in general necessary, 
given the attribute grammar. These notions are explained
in terms of an example grammar which describes 
the scope rules of Algol 60.  Practical questions, such
as the relative efficiency of different evaluation 
schemes, and the ease of adapting the attribute grammar
of a given programming language to the left-to-right 
evaluation scheme are discussed.
