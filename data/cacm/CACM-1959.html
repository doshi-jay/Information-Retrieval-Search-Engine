An Interrupt Based Organization for Management Information Systems

A programming structure, language constructs, and a supervisory system 
organization are proposed
for the design and coding of large shared data base systems.  The
bases for this organization are a generalized interrupt structure
and the newly introduced concept of "file tagging," which is the
process of associating program structures and interrupt generating
conditions with items in the data base.  An algorithm for resolving
conflicts which arise in scheduling the interrupt processing routines
is presented.  DPL, a programming language and supervisory
system in which these concepts are implemented, is used to illustrated
the new organization which is proposed for management information systems.
