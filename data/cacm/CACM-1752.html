Resource Management for a Medium Scale Time-Sharing Operating system

Task scheduling and resource balancing for
a medium size virtual memory paging machine are 
discussed in relation to a combined batch processing
and time-sharing environment.  A synopsis is given 
of the task scheduling and paging algorithms that were implemented,
and the results of comparative simulation 
are given by tracing the development of the algorithms
through six predecessor versions.  Throughout 
the discussion particular emphasis is placed on balancing
the system performance relative to the characteristics 
of all the system resources.  Simulation results relative
to alternate hardware characteristics and the 
effects of program mix and loading variations are also presented.
