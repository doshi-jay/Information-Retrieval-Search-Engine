An Algorithm for Finding a Fundamental Set of Cycles of a Graph

A fast method is presented for finding a fundamental
set of cycles for an undirected finite 
graph.  A spanning tree is grown and the vertices examined
in turn, unexamined vertices being stored 
in a pushdown list to await examination.  One stage
in the process is to take the top element v of the 
pushdown list and examine it, i.e. inspect all those
edges (v,z) of the graph for which z has not yet 
been examined.  If z is already in the tree, a fundamental
cycle is added; if not, the edge (v,z) is 
placed in the tree.  There is exactly one such stage
for each of the n vertices of the graph.  For large 
n, the store required in creases as n^2 and the time as
n^g where g depends on the type of graph involved. 
 g is bounded below by 2 and above by 3, and it is shown
that both bounds are attained.  In terms of 
storage our algorithm is similar to that of Gotlieb and
Corneil and superior to that of Welch; in terms 
of speed it is similar to that of Welch and superior
to that of Gotlieb and Corneil.  Testsshow our 
algorithm to be remarkably efficient (g=2) on random graphs.
