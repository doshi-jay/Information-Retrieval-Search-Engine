A General Formulation of storage Allocation

Formalization of a general computer storage
allocation process is attempted.  With a given 
computer M is associated a fictitious computer M' essentially
identical to M except in respect to possession 
of unbounded primary storage.  Mappings of the total
storage set (internal and external) of M into the 
direct address set of M' are introduced.  A program
sequence P for M' is termed M-admissible (relative 
to a specific execution time period) if there is a mapping
underwhich P and its effective data referents 
are all located in the direct address set of M.  Storage
allocation is considered as a process of establishing 
for an arbitrary M' program  a sequence of mappings, a decoupling
of the program into M-admissible subprograms 
and a linking set of interludes.  An existence proof
in terms of a completely interpretive M program 
as indicated.  Some special cases are discussed.  Various
restrictions on generality of M' programs are 
considered under which more practical realization
of allocation processes becomes tractable.
