A Linear Sieve Algorithm for Finding Prime Numbers

A new algorithm is presented for finding all
primes between 2 and n.  The algorithm executes 
in time proportional to n (assuming that multiplication
of integers not larger than n can be performed 
in unit time).  The method has the same arithmetic complexity
as the algorithm presented by Mairson [6]; 
however, our version is perhaps simpler and more elegant.
 It is also easily extended to find the prime 
factorization of all integers between 2 and n in time proportional to n.
