The LACONIQ Monitor: Time Sharing for Online Dialogues

The LACONIQ (Laboratory Computer Online Inquiry)
Monitor was developed primarily to support 
non-numerical applications such as retrieval from very
large files by means of a "dialogue" between a 
system user and a retrieval application.  The monitor
was designed so that it could work with a small 
computer (an IBM System 360/30).  Therefore techniques
for resource allocation were important.  For this 
reason the use of core storage, computational facilities,
and input-output were all scheduled.  An unusual 
feature of the system is that it is event-driven rather
than clock-driven.  The program segments called 
into execution by the remote CRT consoles are invariably
run to completion rather than "rolled-out" to 
be brought back at a later time.
