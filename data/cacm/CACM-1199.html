A Computer Center Simulation Project

Today's computation centers are based on rapidly
changing technologies of hardware and software 
systems.  It is difficult, therefore, to base decisions
on experience; in most instances, the benefits 
of comparable experience for a given problem situation
are not available.  In this paper, a mathematical 
model of the Lockheed Central Computer Center is formulated
that describes the operation of a computation 
center in terms of information nets, decision processes,
and control functions.  Experiments performed 
with this model, the results of the experiments,
and the application of the results are discussed.
