Optimal Space Allocation on Disk Storage Devices

When the amount of space required for file storage
exceeds the amount which can be kept on-line, 
decisions must be made as to which files are to be permanently
resident and which mountable.  These decisions 
will affect the number of mount requests issued to the
operators.  This is often a bottleneck in a computing 
facility, and reducing the number of mounts thus decreases
turnaround time.  An optimization model for 
the assignment of files to disk packs, and packs to either
resident or nonresident status is presented. 
 Heuristics are suggested for those cases in which
it is inefficient to compute the actual optimum.
