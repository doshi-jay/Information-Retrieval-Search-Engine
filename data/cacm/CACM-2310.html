Language Analysis in the Humanities

The use of the computer in the language-oriented
humanities for exhaustive listing of detail 
(as in indices and concordances) is widespread and accepted
as desirable.  The implications of the computer 
for a "science" of the humanities-a science entailing
gathering data for the construction and testing 
of models-are neither widely recognized nor accepted.
 This paper argues that the computer's  major role 
as to language analysis in the humanities will be the
establishing of such a sciencehus, for those 
areas of the humanities for which rigor and precision
are necessary (e.g. analyzing literature or teaching 
a student to write a composition) the computer
can be a critically important facilitator.
