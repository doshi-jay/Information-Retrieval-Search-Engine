Buffer Allocation in Merge-Sorting

A fixed buffer allocation for merge-sorting
is presented here which minimizes the number of 
input-output operations for a given order of merge.
 When sorting on movable arm disks, the number of 
seeks is equal to the number of input-output operations,
and the seek time usually controls the sort 
time.  First some standard terminology is introduced. 
Then the input buffer allocation method is described, 
followed by an analysis of the improvement to be expected
over more conventional allocation.  This analysis 
makes use of a particular distribution function.  An
analysis of a completely different distribution 
is given which yields similar results.  This suggests
that the results do not depend on a particular 
distribution function.  An optimum output buffer size
is also determined.  It is concluded that this 
buffering allocation can significantly reduce the time
of merge sorting on movable arm disks when the 
input data are not random, and that this output buffer
allocation should be used whether the data is 
random or not.
