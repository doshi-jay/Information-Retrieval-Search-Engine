Approximate Solution of Axially Symmetric Problems

A variety of physical problems in such diverse
fields as electrostatic  field theory, heat 
and ideal fluid flow, and stress concentration theory
reduce, under the assumption of axial symmetry, 
to the study of an elliptic partial differential equation.
 Dirichlet-type problems associated with this 
equation are studied on regions whose boundaries include
a nondegenerate portion of the x-axis and exceedingly 
accurate numerical methods are given for approximating solutions.
