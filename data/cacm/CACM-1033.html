Experimental Personalized Array Translator System

A system designed for intimate man-machine
interaction in a general-purpose problem-solving 
environment is experimentally operational.  The system
utilizers an array-oriented symbolic source language 
containing powerful statement types.  These include numeric,
Boolean, relational and selection operators 
on operands which can be entire arrays.  The system also
permits simple specification of test and argument 
arrays in single statements.  The completely symbolic
operating system includes display and entry of 
program and data.  Sequence control is aided by an interrupt
switch which allows the user to interact 
with the program during execution. In addition to normal
stored program sequencing, the system provides 
trace options and the ability to enter any statement
for immediate execution.  Present implementation 
of the system is with an interpretive translator on an IBM 1620 computer.
