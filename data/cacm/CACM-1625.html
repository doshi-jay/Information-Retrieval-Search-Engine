On the Automatic Simplification of Source-Language Programs

Methods of simplification that can be applied
automatically to programs written in an ALGOL-like 
language are discussed.  The simplifications are based
on the form of the program and the knowledge obtained 
by a processor, without any understanding of what the
program is supposed to do.  These methods have 
been implemented in a processor called SURE that accepts
a program written in JOVIAL and outputs an equivalent 
JOVIAL program that may be shorter and may be executed
faster than the original.  SURE is described, 
some of the problems encountered in automatic improvement
at the source-language level are discussed, 
and further types of automatic program improvement are suggested.
