Use of the Hough Transformation ToDetect Lines and Curves in Pictures

Hough has proposed an interesting and computationally
efficient procedure for detecting lines 
in pictures.  This paper points out that the use of angle-radius
rather than slope-intercept parameters 
simplifies the computation further.  It also shows
how the method can be used for more general curve 
fitting, and gives alternative interpretations
that explain the source of its efficiency.
