BLNSYS-A 1401 Operating System with Braille Capabilities

BLNSYS is an operating system designed for
a 4K 1401 with common optional features and two 
attached tape drives.  Printed output of this system
or of executing programs may be in either English 
or braille.  Even though this system was written for
a small machine with minimal peripheral equipment, 
jobs may be batched, so that card handling and lost
processing time is at a minimum.  This system will 
perform any or all of the following users specified
functions: assemble SPS source decks, post list, 
produce condensed or uncondensed object decks, execute
user's program, list card input to a program, 
list punched output, provide a storage dump, execute
a program submitted for execution as an uncondensed 
object deck under debugging trace control, card-to-braille
conversion, brailled listings of 7040 IBSYS 
batch output, and update or duplicate the system tape
itself.  Input-ouput subroutines are also included 
in the system.
