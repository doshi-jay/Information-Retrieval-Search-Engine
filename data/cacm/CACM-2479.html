Curriculum Recommendations for Graduate Professional
Programs in Information Systems: Recommended 
Addendum on Information Systems Administration

An addendum to the Report of the ACM Curriculum
Committee on Computer Education for Management 
is proposed. The proposed addendum is to include in the curriculum
a course on Information Systems administration. 
It is important for two reasons: (1) the systems designer
must understand the administrative framework 
in which he must operate to work effectively, and (2) an
important objective of the curriculum recommendations 
is to prepare the future manager of the computer activity.
 It is felt that the importance of these two 
reasons justifies the addition of the recommended course.
 The course is outlined in the format of the 
original report.
