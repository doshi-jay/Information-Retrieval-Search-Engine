Symbolic Derivatives Without List Processing, Subroutines, or Recursion

A routine has been developed which computes and
prints out the symbolic derivative of an absolutely 
continuous elementary function of one or several variables.
 No use is made of list-processing languages. 
 The chain rule is applied and the result is edited to
produce results as elegant and efficient as those 
obtained by hand computation.  A subset may be imbeded
in a formula translator to introduce a differentiation 
operator into an "algebraic" programming language.
