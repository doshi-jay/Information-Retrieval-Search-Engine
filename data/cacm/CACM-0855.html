Organization and Structure of Dataon Disk File
Memory Systems for Efficient Sorting and Other 
Data Processing Programs

An approach to the organization and structure
of data on Bryant Disc File Memory Systems for 
sorting and performing other data processing functions
is presented.  The following areas are covered: 
characteristics of Bryant Disc File Systems on the Bendix
G-20 and RCA 301; two proposed "chaining" structures 
for data; and functions of a Disk File Executive Routine.
 The concepts for sorting and performing file 
maintenance processing using the proposed structure and
executive routine are discussed.  Additionally, 
it is shown that sorting can be accomplished
without the use of disk storage work areas.
