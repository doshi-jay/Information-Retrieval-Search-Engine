Estimation of Heart Parameters Using Skin Potential Measurements

A fundamental problem of vector cardiography
is the estimation of the state of the heart on 
the basis of skin potential measurements.  A mathematical
model relating ventricular dipoles to surface 
potentials is sketched.  Then it is shown that the inverse
problem-that of determining electrical heart 
parameters on the basis of skin potential measurements-may
be viewed as a nonlinear multipoint boundary 
value problem.  A feasible solution, employing quasilinearization
and high-speed digital computers, is 
given.
