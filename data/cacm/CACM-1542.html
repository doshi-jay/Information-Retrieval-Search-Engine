A Microprogrammed Implementation of EULER on IBM System/360 Model 30

An experimental processing system for the algorithmic
language EULER has been implemented in 
microprogramming on an IBM System/360 Model 30 using a
second Read-Only Storage unit.  The system consists 
of a microprogrammed compiler and a microprogrammed
String Language Interpreter, and of an I/O control 
program written in 360 machine language.  The system is described
and results are given in terms of microprogram 
and main storage space required and compiler and interpreter
performance obtained.  The role of microprogramming 
is stressed, which opens a new dimension in the processing
of interpretive code.  The structure and content 
of a higher level language can be matched by an appropriate
interpretive language which can be executed 
efficiently by microprograms on existing computer hardware.
