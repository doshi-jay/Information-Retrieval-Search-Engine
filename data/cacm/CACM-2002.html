AMESPLOT-A Higher Level Data Plotting Software System

AMESPLOT is an extensible software system designed to make the display of 
data as simple, painless, and neat as possible.  The system described is 
hardware-independent and has been implemented on a variety of installations,
of different manufacturers, having diverse configurations.  The elements 
common to all types of data plots are outlined and the way in which these 
elements may be combined into a system based on simple modules is demonstrated.
These modules are specified independently and are independent of the axis
systems or other attributes of the plot.  This enables plots of any
complexity to be constructed by adding or replacing modules.  The
basic syntax of AMESPLOT is outlined, and a brief description is given
of its current utility software, consisting of "macros" to produce
self-scaled plots, formal tablets of text-interspersed with subplots,
map coastlines, and 3-D plots.  The system was formulate
d in a way such that the user could supply the minimum of information,
and it should be fully integrable with user's program written
in most conventional higher languages.  The functions of positioning,
locating, and scaling (in the layout of multiple subplots) of
axes, labels, and all other elements of the plot are handled automatically
by the software system unless the user specifies otherwise.  The structuring 
of plots from multiple, independent, self-contained subplots is described.
Transformation, projection, scaling, rotation, or shifting of entire plots or 
subplots by the action of one or more simple modules is possible.  The user 
may interact freely with AMESPLOT at three levels, enabling him to construct 
his own data markers, alphabetic characters, and transformations, and
to produce a variety of artistic and other effects.
