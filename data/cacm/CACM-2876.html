Intentional Resolution of Privacy Protection in Database Systems

Traditionally, privacy protection in database
systems is understood to be the control over 
what information a given user can get from a database.
 This paper is concerned with another, independent, 
dimension of privacy protection, the control over what
a user is allowed to do with a piece of information 
supplied to him by the database.  The ability to condition
the supply of information on its intended 
use is called here "intentional resolution" of privacy
protection.  The practical importance of intentional 
resolution is demonstrated by several examples, and its realization
is discussed.  It is shown that intentional 
resolution can be achieved, but that it involves a radical
change from the traditional approach to the 
process of user-database interaction.  In particular,
it appears to be necessary for the database to 
impose a certain amount of control over the internal
behavior of users' programs which interact with 
it.  A model for user-database interaction
which admits such a control is developed.
