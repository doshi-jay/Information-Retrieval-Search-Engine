WYLBUR: An Interactive Text Editing and Remote Job Entry System

WYLBUR is a comprehensive system for manipulating
all kinds of text, such as computer programs, 
letters, and manuscripts, using typewriter terminals
connected to a computer.  It has facilities for 
remote job entry and retrieval as well as facilities
for text alignment and justification.  A powerful 
method for addressing text by content is provided.  This
paper describes the external appearance of WYLBUR 
as well as its internal structure.  A short description
of the major features of ORVYL, a general purpose 
time-sharing system which operates in conjunction with WYLBUR, is also included.
