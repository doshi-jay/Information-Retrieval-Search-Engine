Storing a Sparse Table

The problem of storing and searching large sparse tables is ubiquitous in 
computer science.  The standard technique for storing such tables is
hashing, but hashing has poor worst-case performance.  We propose
a good worst-case method for storing a static table of n entries,
each an integer between 0 and N - 1.  The method requires 0(n) w
words of storage and allows O(logn N) access time.  Although our method
is a little complicated to use in practice, our analysis shows
why a simpler algorithm used for compressing LR parsing tables works so well.
