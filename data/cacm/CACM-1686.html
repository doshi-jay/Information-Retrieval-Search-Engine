Computer Synthesis of Holograms for 3-D Display

Optical and digital holography are reviewed.
 The mathematical model and computational techniques 
of the authors' digital holographic process are discussed,
and applications of computer holography are 
suggested.  Computer holograms have been made of three-dimensional
objects which give faithful reconstructions, 
even in white light.  A new approach based on point
apertures for the image is discussed.  Photographs 
of the images reconstructed from digital holograms are presented.
