A Locally-Organized Parser for Spoken Input

This paper describes LPARS, a locally-organized
parsing system, designed for use in a continuous 
speech recognizer.  LPARS processes a string of phonemes
which contains ambiguity and error. The system 
is locally-organized in the sense that it builds local
clean structures from reliable word candidates
recognized anywhere in an input utterance.  These local
structures are used as "islands of reliability" 
to guide the search for more highly garbled
words which might complete the utterance.
