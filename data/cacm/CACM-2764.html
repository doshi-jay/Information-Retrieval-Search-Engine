An Intelligent Analyzer and Understander of English

The paper describes a working analysis and generation
program for natural language, which handles 
paragraph length input.  Its core is a system of preferential
choice between deep semantic patterns, 
based on what we call "semantic density."  The system
is contrasted: (1) with syntax oriented linguistic 
approaches, and (2) with theorem proving
approaches to the understanding problem.
