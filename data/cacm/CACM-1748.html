A Scheduling Philosophy for Multiprocessing Systems

A collection of basic ideas is presented, which
have been evolved by various workers over the 
past four years to provide a suitable framework for the
design and analysis of multiprocessing systems. 
 The notions of process and state vector are discussed,
and the nature of basic operations on processes 
is considered.  Some of the connections between processes
and protection are analyzed.  A very general 
approach to priority-oriented scheduling is described,
and its relationship to conventional interrupt 
systems is explained.  Some aspects of time-oriented
scheduling are considered. The implementation of 
the scheduling mechanism is analyzed in detail and the
feasibility of embodying it in hardware established. 
 Finally, several methods for interlocking the execution
of independent processes are presented and compared.
