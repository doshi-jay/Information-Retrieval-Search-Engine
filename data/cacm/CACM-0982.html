An Inductive Approach to Language Translation

The possibility of natural language translation
by means of fixed operations on example translations 
is considered.  The conception of sentence translation
which motivates the work is informally presented, 
and the measurement of physical similarity in pairs of
strings is discussed, a notion which plays a central 
role in the proposed type of translator.  Experimental
evidence is presented in support of the premise 
upon which this conception is based.
