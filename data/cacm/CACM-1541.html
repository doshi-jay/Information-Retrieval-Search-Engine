A Language for Modeling and Simulating Dynamic Systems

The general objective of this language is
to facilitate both the modeling and experimental 
aspects of simulation studies.  The ability to represent
systems containing highly interactive processes 
is an essential feature.  The nature of the language,
and the role of the process concept, is presented 
by means of an extended example.
