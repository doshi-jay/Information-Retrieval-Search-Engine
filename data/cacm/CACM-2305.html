The "Plankalkul" of Konrad Zuse: A Forerunner
of Today's Programming Languages

Plankalkul was an attempt by Korrad Zuse in
the 1940's to devise a notational and conceptual 
system for writing what today is termed a program.  Although
this early approach to a programming language 
did not lead to practical use, the plan is described
here because it contains features that are standard 
in today's programming languages.  The investigation
is of historical interest; also, it may provide 
insights that would lead to advancements in the state
of the art.  Using modern programming terminology, 
the Plankalkul is presented to the extent it has possible
to reconstruct it from the published literature.
