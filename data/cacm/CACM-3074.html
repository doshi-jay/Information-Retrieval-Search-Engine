A Time- and Space- Efficient Garbage Compaction Algorithm

Given an area of storage containing scattered,
marked nodes of differing sizes, one may wish 
to rearrange them into a compact mass at one end of the
area while revising all pointers to marked nodes 
to show their new locations.  An algorithm is described
here which accomplishes this task in linear time 
relative to the size of the storage area, and in a space
of the order of one bit for each pointer.  The 
algorithm operates by reversibly encoding the situation
(that a collection of locations point to a single 
location) by a linear list, emanating from the pointed-to
location, passing through the pointing locations, 
and terminating with the pointed-to location's transplanted contents.
