An Interactive Command Generating Facility

A facility to permit conversationally controlled tasks
to be executed in a noninteractive environment is proposed.
A means by which programs can generate interactive time-sharing commands
and receive the corresponding output response is presented.  The commands 
will be invoked as if they had been typed at a console keyboard.  It is 
argued that this facility will help overcome some of the current limitations 
in man-computer communication. A set of functions to accomplish the above 
which could be embedded into any string processing language is suggested, 
and necessary information pertinent to implementation of the facility on 
existing time-sharing systems is given.
