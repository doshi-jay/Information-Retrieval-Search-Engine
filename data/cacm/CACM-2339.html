Computer-Assigned Codes from Verbal Responses

It is often desirable to convert verbal responses
to multidigit codes. This conversion is generally 
accomplished by clerk-coders.  A study was conducted to test
the feasibility of translating verbal descriptions 
to numerical codes in a computer program.  Primary emphasis
was placed on computerized construction of 
a reference file of verbal descriptions for use by the
program.  The results of the study clearly show 
that such procedures are feasible.
