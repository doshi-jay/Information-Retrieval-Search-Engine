Machine Independence: Its Technology and Economics

A survey is offered of techniques for transferring
programs, and especially compilers, from 
one computer to another.  Of the methods examined, the
"bootstrap" technique is singled out for detailed 
discussion, with emphasis on its economics. The considerations
that determine the applicability of bootstrapping 
in any specific case are discussed, and an attempt
is made to assign appropriate qualitative weights 
to them.  Finally, reasons are given for believing that the
machine-independence problem is being substantially 
diminished by current trends in computer design, and
that it is this process of convergence in hardware 
design rather than any foreseeable software developments
that will lead to its satisfactory resolution.
