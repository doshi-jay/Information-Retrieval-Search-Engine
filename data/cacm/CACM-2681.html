Dynamic Memory Repacking

A probabilistic model of a multiprogramming system
is exercised in order to determine the conditions 
under which the dynamic repacking of main memory is beneficial.
 An expression is derived for the maximum 
interference that a repacking process may introduce
before the original performance of the system is 
degraded.  Alternative approaches to repacking are discussed,
and the operating conditions that lead 
to improved system throughput through repacking are delineated.
