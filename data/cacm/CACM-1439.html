Mechanization of the Curve Fitting Process: DATAN

A process for fitting a curve to approximate data
and the problem it creates for the engineer-programmer 
is defined.  An approach has also been defined and a system
has been written for the SRU 1107 to mechanize 
a major portion of this process.  The techniques developed
to accomplish the mechanization are largely 
empirical, and are dependent for their information
only on the actual data points.
