Double-Precision Squares Root for The CDC-3600

In January of 1960, the late Hans J. Maehly completed
a summary of approximations to the elementary 
functions for the CDC-1604 computer.  The approximations
and techniques suggested by Maehly are equally 
applicable to the second large computer in the CDC line,
the 3600.  Unlike the 1604, however, the 3600 
has built-in double-precision floating-point arithmetic.
 The present work, largely inspired by the successes 
of Maehly and his associates, concerns the extension of one
of Maehly's ideas to a double-precision subroutine 
for the 3600.
