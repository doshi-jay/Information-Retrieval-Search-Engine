An Interpretive Input Routine for Linear Programming

In this descriptive article an input code
is presented which greatly simplifies data input 
to any linear programming solution routine, for subsequent
use either as a pedagogical device or for 
solving rather small LP problems.  This latter (limited)
use derives not at all from inherent limitations 
in the code itself, but from an efficiency evaluation:
large LP problems would doubtless benefit from 
an input system more suited for bulk data handling than
the input code described.  From a user's standpoint, 
input appears almost exactly as a textbook presentation
of the LP problem (limited only by a keypunch's 
inability to write subscripts, etc.).  The input interpreter
scans column wise, thus no fixed format 
data preparation is required.  The user may also, under
very general requirements only, liberally use 
editorial comments throughout the input deck as an
aid in identification, e.g., of row constraints.  
The article includes examples of input, output from a
solution routine presently in use, and a skeleton 
flowchart of the input interpreter.
