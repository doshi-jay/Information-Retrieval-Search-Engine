Some Characteristics of Sorting in Computing
Systems Using Random Access Storage Devices 

The substantial differences in characteristics
of random access storage and tape devices dictate 
that concepts and objectives of computer program design
be considered from the viewpoint of the external 
file medium used.  This is particularly true in the
case of sorting.  In a tape-oriented system, the 
major sorting problem is that of minimizing merge time
despite the limited orders of merge possible. 
 In contrast, sorting in a random access-oriented system
encourages the selection of the optimum order 
of merge from many possible orders.  The latter problem
is discussed in this paper, along with criteria 
developed for determining the optimum order of merge according
to the various properties of random access 
storage devices.  Attention is also given to the problem
of key sorting versus record sorting and the 
possibly serious disadvantage of key sorting on a random access system.
