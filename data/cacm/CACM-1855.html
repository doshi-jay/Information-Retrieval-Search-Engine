A Program for the Syntactic Analysis of English Sentences

A program is described which produces syntactic
analyses of English sentences with respect 
to a transformational grammar.  The main features of the
analyzer are that it uses only a limited dictionary 
of English words and that it pursues all analysis paths
simultaneously while processing the sentence 
from left to right.  The form of representation used
for the dictionary and the grammar is indicated 
and an outline account is given of the analysis procedure.
 Techniques for keeping the size of the analysis 
record within reasonable limits and for avoiding the need
for dynamic application of certain transformational 
rules are described.   A number of examples of output
produced by the program are given.  The output 
includes timing information.
