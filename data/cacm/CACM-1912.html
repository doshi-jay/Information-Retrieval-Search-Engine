Simulation of Outpatient Appointment Systems

An experimental computer program is described
which simulates appointment systems employed 
by outpatient departments of hospitals.  Both major kinds
of appointment systems-individual and block-can 
be simulated.  The purpose of the Simulator is to enable
the user to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative 
appointment systems in a given clinical environment.
