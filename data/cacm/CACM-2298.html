An Environment for Research in Microprogramming and Emulation

The development of the research project in
microprogramming and emulation at State University 
of New York at Buffalo consisted of three phases: the
evaluation of various possible machines to support 
this research; the decision to purchase one such machine,
which appears to be superior to the others 
considered; and the organization and definition of goals
for each group in the project.  Each of these 
phases is reported, with emphasis placed on the
early results achieved in this research.
