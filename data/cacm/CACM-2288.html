File Organization: The Consecutive Retrieval Property

The consecutive retrieval property is an important
relation between a query set and record 
set.  Its existence enables the design of an information
retrieval system with a minimal search time 
and no redundant storage.  Some important theorems on
the consecutive retrieval property are proved in 
this paper.  Conditions under which the consecutive retrieval
property exists and remain invariant have 
been established.  An outline for designing an information
retrieval system based on the consecutive 
retrieval property is also discussed.
