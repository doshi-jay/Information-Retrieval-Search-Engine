On the Problem of Communicating Complex Information

The nature of the difficulty involved in communicating
mathematical results between scientists 
using a computer based information retrieval system
is examined.  The problem is analyzed in terms of 
psychological and information-processing processes, and
what turns out to be a vicious circle of effects 
is described.  These include ways of augmenting written
natural language by various notational and linguistic 
devices, the exhibition of the structure inherent in the
information we are communicating, and a sophisticated 
interactive system controlled by computer.
