Internal and Tape Sorting Using the Replacement-Selection Technique

A general technique for sequencing unsorted
records is presented.  The technique is shown to 
be applicable for the first stage of a generalized sort
program (the formation of initial strings) as 
well as for sorting records within a memory storage (an
internal sort).  It is shown that given N records 
in memory storage, records are sequenced using 1+log2
N tests per record, that initial string lengths 
will average 2N for random input records, and that reading,
writing and processing can be accomplished 
simultaneously if the computer permits such overlap.
