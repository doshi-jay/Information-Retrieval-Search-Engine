Solution of Transcendental Equations by Series Reversion

An algorithm is developed for expressing the
solution Y, of the equation F(Y) = G(X) as a power 
series in (X - X0) when f and g are given as power series,and
the root Y0, is known at Y=X0.  The algorithm 
is illustrated for the equation Y^Y = X, i.e., (1+y)*ln(1+y) = ln(1+x).
