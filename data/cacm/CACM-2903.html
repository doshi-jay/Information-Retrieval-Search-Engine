Improving Programs by the Introduction of Recursion

A new technique of program transformation,
called "recursion in troduction," is described and 
applied to two algorithms which solve pattern matching problems.
 By using recursion in troduction, algorithms 
which manipulate a stack are first translated into
recursive algorithms in which no stack operations 
occur.  These algorithms are then subjected to a second
transformation, a method of recursion elimination 
called "tabulation," to produce programs with a very
efficient running time.  In particular, it is shown 
how the fast linear pattern matching algorithm of Knuth,
Morris, and Pratt can be derived in a few steps 
from a simple nonlinear stack algorithm.
