When Your Computer Needs a Lawyer

Possible liability for negligence, for other
torts (such as slander of credit) and for liability 
under theories of express or implied warranty (guarantees)
are discussed, and legal complications are 
explained, so that users, operators, owners, and leasors
of computers may be alerted to potential legal 
problems. Focus is also on trouble spots in contracting
for data processing services, in automating record 
keeping operations, in deciding whether or not to automate
certain operations, and in complying with 
statutes and regulation relating to record keeping.
 Information is given on patents, copyrights and 
trade secret protection for programs, and the problem
of using copyrighted material in information storage 
and retrieval systems, including the pending
copyright and patent revision bills.
