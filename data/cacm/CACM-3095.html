A Selective Traversal Algorithm for Binary Search Trees

The problem of selecting data items from
a binary search tree according to a list of range 
conditions is considered.  The process of visiting a
minimal number of nodes to retrieve data satisfying 
the range conditions is called selective traversal.  Presented
in this paper is an algorithm for selective 
traversal which uses a tag field for each node in the
tree.  The algorithm is particularly useful and 
efficient when examination of data is more time
consuming than examination of a tag field.
