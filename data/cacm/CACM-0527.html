The Description List of Concepts

A concept is defined as a class of objects
whose members can be distinguished by processing 
its properties.  Property is defined to mean a partition
of the set of all objects into disjoint classes. 
 The formal definition of a concept is recursive in nature.
 A concept is described by a list structure. 
 A one-to-one correspondence is established between the
recursive definition of a concept and its description 
list structure.  Like the definition, the description
list structure of a concept is also built up from 
elementary list structures by a recursive process. 
The list structures obtained this way are compared 
with the description list structure discussed
by the author in a previous publication.
