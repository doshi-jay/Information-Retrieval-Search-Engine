Remarks on the Practical Solution of Characteristic Value Problems

This paper is concerned with the practical
solution of characteristic value problem for an 
ordinary differential equation.  It is at once apparent
that sequential computers, be they digital or 
analog, solve initial value problems, rather than boundary
value problems, and some mathematical process 
must be found to compensate for the machine's inadequacy.
 (Compensating for machine imperfection is, 
of course, the normal activity of the numerical analyst.)
 A number of other papers have applied particular 
devices to particular problems.  The purpose of this
note is to establish a mathematical framework or 
model for these practical procedures and thus assist in
the use and extension of the ideas in other particular 
problems.
