On the Approximate Solution of Delta(u)=F(u)

Three-dimensional Dirichlet problems for Delta(u)=F(u),
Fu >= 0, are treated numerically by 
an exceptionally fast, exceptionally accurate numerical
method.  Programming details, numerous examples 
and mathematical theory are suppliedxtension of the
method in a natural way to n-dimensional problems 
is indicated by means of a 4-dimensional example.
