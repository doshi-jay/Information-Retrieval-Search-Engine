A Fourier Series Method for the Numerical Solution
of a Class of Parabolic Partial Differential 
Equations*

A Fourier series method is described which, when
applied to a certain class of parabolic partial 
differential equations, reduces the problem to a system
of ordinary differential equations.  An application 
is given for which the method shows a considerable advantage
over conventional finite difference methods.
