A Set of Basic Input-Output Procedures (Algorithm 335 [15])

By means of the primitives in symbol, outsymbol
and length, as requested by this journal's 
Algorithms Policy [Comm. ACM 10 (Nov. 67), 729] a basic
set of input-output procedures is defined aiming 
at quality and flexibility.  Outreal, for instance, is
written as a derived procedure; it outputs using 
the fixed point or the floating point representation,
and rounds properly.  Variants can easily be written 
because of the explicit call of the procedures decompose
integer and decompose real.  The highly recommended 
practice of echoing input is made easy with one subset
of derived procedures (ioi, ior, iob, ioa).  The 
documentation of output in the form of equivalent ALGOL
statements is also provided when use is made 
of the subset oti, otr, otb, ota.  The Berkeley style
of providing information on the form of output 
using prior calls of procedures such as real format is
defined.  A use of the parameter outchannel to 
provide information for simultaneous output to several
channels is suggested.  Interrelationship between 
the declared procedures is furnished in tabular form.
