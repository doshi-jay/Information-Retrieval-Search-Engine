SHARER, a Time Sharing System for the CDC 6600

A time sharing system embedded within the
standard batch processing system for the CDC 6600 
is described.  The system is general purpose and file-based,
providing facilities for file input, manipulation, 
editing, compilation, and conversational execution.
 It uses a simple scheme for system extension for 
a machine with only one relocation and memory bound register.
 No attempt was made to use reentrant code, 
or to simulate segmentation or paging.  Implementation
time was approximately six man-years, with the 
majority of the code being written in FORTRAN.
