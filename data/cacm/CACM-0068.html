The Role of the University in Computers,
Data Processing and Related Fields

A study was made of university programs in
the United States in the fields of computers, data 
processing, operations research, and other closely related
fields.  University policies, organization, 
administration, faculties, students, researches, curricula,
equipment, and financing were investigated. 
 An integrated university program is recommended reflecting
the conviction that many present activities 
related to computers will develop into disciplines and
as such are the legitimate province of the university 
scholar.  Details on a recommended Graduate
School of "Computer Sciences" are given.
