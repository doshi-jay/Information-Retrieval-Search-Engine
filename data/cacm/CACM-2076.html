Cubic Splines on Uniform Meshes

A very simple procedure is presented for constructing cubic splines,
periodic or nonperiodic, on uniform meshes.  Arcs of two cubics suffice
to construct a basis of cardinal splines.  An algorithm is given which 
requires only minimal storage and computation and permits easy trade-off 
of one against the other.
