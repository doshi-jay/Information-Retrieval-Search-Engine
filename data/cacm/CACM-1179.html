PUFFT-The Purdue University Fast FORTRAN Translator

A core resident, compile-and-go system designed
for the IBM 7090/7094 computer is described. 
 In little more than half of the 32k word core memory
PUFFT provides a monitor for job sequencing, a 
translator for the full FORTRAN IV language, the FORTRAN
subroutine library, an input--output system 
for use at compile time and at execute time, and a rather
elaborate diagnostic message writing routine. 
 Batches of small- and medium-sized FORTRAN IV source
language programs are processed at very high speeds. 
 Language compatibility has been maintained so that
programs may be debugged in the PUFFT system and 
then recompiled and run in the IBJOB-IBFTC system supplied by the manufacturer.
