An Automatic Grading Scheme for Simple Programming Exercises

A discussion is given of alterations that were
made to a typical university operating system 
to record the results of programming exercises in three
different languages, including assembly language. 
 In this computer-controlled grading scheme provision
is made for testing with programmer-supplied data 
and for final runs with system-supplied data.  Exercises
run under the scheme may be mixed with other 
programs, and no special recognition of exercises by the operators is necessary.
