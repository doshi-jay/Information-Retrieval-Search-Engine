GIT-A Heuristic Program for Testing Pairs
of Directed Line Graphs for Isomorphism*

Given a pair of directed line graphs, the problem
of ascertaining whether or not they are isomorphic 
is one for which no efficient algorithmic solution is known.
 Since a straightforward enumerative algorithm 
might require 40 years of running time on a very high
speed computer in order to compare two 15-node 
graphs, a more sophisticated approach seems called
for.  The situation is similar to that prevailing 
in areas such as game-playing and theorem-proving, where
practical algorithms are unknown (for the interesting 
cases), but where various practical though only partially
successful techniques are available.  Git-Graph 
Isomorphism Tester-incorporates a variety of processes
that attempt to narrow down the search for an 
isomorphism, or to demonstrate that none exists.  No one
scheme is relied upon exclusively for a solution, 
and the program is designed to avoid excessive computation
along fruitless lines.  GIT has been written 
in the COMIT language and successfully tested on the IBM 7090.
