Computers in Group Theory: a Survey

Computers are being applied to an increasingly
diverse range of problems in group theory.  
The most important areas of application at present are
coset enumeration, subgroup lattices, automorphism 
groups of finite groups, character tables, and commutator
calculus.  Group theory programs range from 
simple combinatorial or numerical programs to large
symbol manipulation systems.  In this survey the 
more important algorithms in use are described and contrasted,
and results which have been obtained using 
existing programs are indicated.  An extensive bibliography is included.
