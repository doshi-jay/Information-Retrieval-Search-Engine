Storage Reorganization Techniques for
Matrix Computation in a Paging Environment

In order to multiply matrices while minimizing
the number of page fetches required, it is often more efficient to
reorganize the data into submatrix form and to use block multiplication 
rather than to use the best known algorithms which leave the
matrices stored in row-(or column-)oriented form.  An efficient
method for accomplishing this reorganization is given.  This also
makes possible the derivation of an asymptotically better bound
for multiplication of matrices given in row-oriented form by adapting
the technique of Strassen to the reorganized data.  The reorganization/block 
multiplication scheme is shown to be advantageous for
matrices and pages of realistic size; the Strassen adaptation is
not.  The former scheme is also shown to be advantageous even if
the transpose of one of the matrices is available at no additional cost.
