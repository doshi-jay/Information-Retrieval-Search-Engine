GPL, a Truly General Purpose Language

A truly general purpose programming language,
GPL, is described which contains facilities for 
constructing (within the language) new data types as
well as facilities for operations performed upon 
them.  The basic language is minimal in the sense that
no basic element can be derived from the others 
with high efficiency in the object programs.  Constructs
like the ALGOL 60 for-statements,and if-statements 
are not basic; they are special types of procedures.
 New "symbols" (underlined words in ALGOL 60) are 
implicitly defined by usage in other declarations.  As
part words are definable, packed words are handled 
as easily as full words.  "Address" variables
(pointers) are included in full generality.
