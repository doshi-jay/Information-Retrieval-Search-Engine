Demand Paging Through Utilization of Working Sets on the MANIAC II

A hardware implementation on the Maniac II computer
of the working set model for demand paging, 
as introduced by Denning, is discussed.  Characteristics
of the Maniac II are given, along with a description 
of the basic demand paging scheme and the associate memory
which has been added to the Maniac II hardware. 
 Finally, a description of the hardware design for implementation
of the working set model is discussed 
and a specification of the actions taken under various
conditions which may arise during the operation 
of the full working set model, demand paging system is given.
