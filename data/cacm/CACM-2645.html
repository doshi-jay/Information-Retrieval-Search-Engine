Two Languages for Estimating Program Efficiency

Two languages enabling their users to estimate
the efficiency of computer programs are presented. 
 The program whose efficiency one wishes to estimate is written
in the first language, a go-to-less programming 
language which includes most of the features of Algol
60.  The second language consists of interactive 
commands enabling its users to provide additional information
about the program written in the first 
language and to output results estimating its efficiency.
 Processors for the two languages are also 
described.  The first processor is a syntax-directed
translator which compiles a program into a symbolic 
formula representing the execution time for that program.
 The sound processor is a set of procedures 
for that program.  The second processor is a set of
procedures for algebraic manipulation which can be 
called by the user to operate on the formula produced
by the first processor.  Examples of the usage 
of the two languages are included.  The limitations of
the present system, its relation to Knuth's work 
on the analysis of algorithms, and some of the directions
for further research are also discussed.
