The Manchester Mark I and Atlas: A His torical Perspective

In 30 years of computer design at Manchester University
two systems stand out: the Mark I (developed 
over the period 1946-49) and the Atlas (1955-62). 
This paper places each computer in its his torical 
context and then describes the architecture and system
software in present-day terminology.  Several 
design concepts such as address-generation and store
management have evolved in the progression from 
Mark I to Atlas.  The wider impact of Manchester innovations
in these and other areas is discussed, and 
the contemporary performance of the Mark I and Atlas is evaluated.
