Loader Standardization for Overlay Programs

The overlay capability is described for four
of the third generation computer systems: CDC-6000, 
GE-635, IBM-360, and UNIVAC-1108.  A critique of the
first three systems is based on actual experience 
with a large overlaid trajectory simulation program;
a short history and description of this program 
is presented.  A standardization of minimum capabilities
for loaders is recommended so that programs 
which must operate under more than one computer system
may be easily converted and maintained.  A proposal 
that overlay software incorporates a memory occupation
specification concept instead of the conditional 
tree structure is delineated.  This concept provides
more efficient and cost-effective utilization of 
the memory as well as increased flexibility in program structure.
