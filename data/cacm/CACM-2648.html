A Design for a Number Theory Package
with an Optimized Trial Division routine

A number theory package is described which uses
doubly linked list structures for storing multiprecise 
integers.  The package has been coded in IBM's Basic
Assembly Language and makes heavy use of the macro 
language and conditional assembly.  An optimally coded
trial division routine is also described which 
can be used to determine the unique factorization of large integers.
