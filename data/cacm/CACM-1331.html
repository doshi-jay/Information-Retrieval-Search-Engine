Code Structures for Protection and Manipulation of Variable-Length Items

When items are made up of a variable number
of characters, each containing the same number 
of bits, certain control information (partition symbols)
is inserted to mark their separations.  Since 
errors in identification of these control characters
can lead to serious trouble, methods of protecting 
these symbols are indicated.  A 6-bit code assignment
of alphanumeric characters for fixed word-length 
computers is given and its suitability for error detection
and variable-length item manipulation is shown. 
 Also indicated is its flexibility during certain arithmetic operations.
