Data, Documentation and Decision Tables

In business data processing systems, it is
necessary to be able to define and document data, 
files, programs and decision rules in a way that adequately
represents both (1) their changing information 
content, and (2) their continuous interaction.  Tabular
description makes this possible, being notably 
objective, through and economical in cost and time when
systems must be analyzed and programs prepared 
or modified.  To show how quickly tabular techniques
make an unfamiliar system manageable, a detailed 
example and a self-test are provided.
