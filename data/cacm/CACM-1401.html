Quasilinearization and the Calculation of Eigenvalues

Several eigenvalue problems for systems of
ordinary differential equations are considered. 
 They are resolved computationally using the quasilinerization
technique, a quadratically convergent 
successive approximation scheme related to
the Newton-Raphson-Kantorovich method.
