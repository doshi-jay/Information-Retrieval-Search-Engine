Optimal Storage Allocation for Serial Files

A computer system uses several serial files.  The files reside on a 
direct-access storage device in which storage space is limited.  Records are 
added to the files either by jobs in batch processing mode, or by on-line 
transactions. Each transaction (or job) generates a demand vector which 
designates the space required in each file for record addition. Whenever one 
file runs out of space, the system must be reorganized.  This paper considers 
several criteria for best allocating storage space to the files.
