Fortran 77

There is a new standard Fortran.  The official
title is "American National Standard Programming 
Language Fortran, X3.9-1978," but it is more commonly
referred to as "Fortran 77," since its development 
was completed in 1977.  It replaces the Fortran standard
designated X3.9-1966.  This paper describes 
many of the features of Fortran 77 and also provides
some information about how and why the standard 
was developed.
