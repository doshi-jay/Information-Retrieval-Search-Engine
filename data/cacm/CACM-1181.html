A Simple Data Transmission System Using the Office Telephone

A method has evolved for transmitting data of
a type originating in many laboratory situation 
direct to a central computer.  The method requires almost
no specialized equipment and uses any ordinary

include cardiac-output calculations, radio-activity 
tracer studies and neurophysiology time-sequence studies of nerve impulses.
