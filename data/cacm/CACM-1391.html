Computer Experiments in Finite Algebra

A medium-scale programming system is written
in MAD and FAP on the IBM 7094 to manipulate some 
of the objects of modern algebra: finite groups, maps
and sets of maps, subsets and sets of subsets, 
constant integers and truth-values.  Designed to operate
in a time-sharing environment, the system can 
serve as a teacher's aid to the undergraduate student of
modern algebra, as well as for the working scientist 
or engineer wishing to familiarize himself with the subset.
