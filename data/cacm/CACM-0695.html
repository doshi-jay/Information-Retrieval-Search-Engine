Use of the Disk File on Stretch

The paper begins by briefly describing the
Stretch (IBM 7030) computer with special emphasis 
given to the organization and operation of its input-output
equipment.  Physical characteristics of the 
two-disk system (4,194,304 72-bit words, 8 usec-per-word
transmission rate, etc.) are noted.  Timing 
limitations due to arm motion and disk rotation are discussed.
 Applications of disk usage are discussed 
separately for problem programs and for systems programs
such as compilers and the supervisory program. 
Approximately 260,000 words of disk storage are reserved
for the storage of systems programs and the 
subroutine library.  Problem programs, however, are not
currently filed on the disk.  Certain programming 
techniques are discussed for transmitting words between
disk and core storage with minimum delaying and 
interruption of the arithmetic unit.  Dumps on disk are
considered for both recovery from computer malfunction 
and for mathematical or physical developments during
the calculation.  Some comments are made regarding 
the reliability, economics, utility and weaknesses or
limitations of the disk system.  Several possible 
future applications are noted which appear to have disk connotations.
