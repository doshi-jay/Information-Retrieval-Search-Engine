CODAS: A Data Display System

CODAS, a Customer Oriented Data System, is
a user-oriented data retrieval and display system. 
 The command language of the system provides the user
with an easy means for specifying data retrieval 
and display requests.  Data is displayed as tables and
graphs produced in a format ready for publication. 
 In this paper the statements of the request language
and the general system design are described.
