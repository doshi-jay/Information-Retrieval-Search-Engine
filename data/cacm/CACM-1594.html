An Algorithm for Generating Permutations

An algorithm is described which under repeated
application generates all permutations of K 
elements.  Only the previously generated permutation,
the constant K, and a temporary index are needed. 
 Starting with a particular ordering of K elements (abcd),
repeated application of the algorithm will 
generate K-1 additional permutations by K-1 successive
rotations.  From the initial circular ordering 
of K objects, another circular ordering can be obtained
by rotating the K-1 lowest elements.  For each 
new K-1 circular ordering, another K-2 can be obtained
by rotating the K-2 lowest elements.  By continuing 
in this manner, applications of the algorithm will generate
all (K-1)! circular orderings, or since each 
circular ordering yields K permutations the
algorithm generates all K! permutations.
