ASP-A Ring Implemented Associative Structure Package

ASP is a general purpose Associative Data
Structure Package in which an arbitrary number of 
data items and an arbitrary number of the relationships
between these data items may be represented. 
 A special picture language is described which has proved
very useful for drawing ASP structures on paper. 
 ASP structures are built and manipulated by means
of a series of macro calls, which are outlined in 
the Appendix.  Emphasis is on the philosophy of the system
rather than a particular implementation, though 
sufficient information is included to enable the
reader to produce his own implementation of ASP.
