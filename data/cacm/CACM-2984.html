Cost/Utilization: A Measure of System Performance

A method is presented for evaluating computer
system performance in terms of a cost/utilization 
factor and a measure of imbalance.  These coefficients
indicate the extent to which the total system 
cost is effectively utilized.  The method includes a
technique for the visual representation of system 
performance.
