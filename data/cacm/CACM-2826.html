Interactive Skeleton Techniques for Enhancing
Motion Dynamics in Key Frame Animation

A significant increase in the capability for
controlling motion dynamics in key frame animation 
is achieved through skeleton control.  This technique
allows an animator to develop a complex motion 
sequence by animating a stick figure representation
of an image.  This control sequence is then used 
to drive an image sequence through the same movement.
 The simplicity of the stick figure image encourages 
a high level of interaction during the design stage. 
Its compatibility with the basic key frame animation 
technique permits skeleton control to be applied selectively
to only those components of a composite 
image sequence that require enhancement.
