Common Phrases and Minimum-Space Text Storage

A method for saving storage space for text
strings, such as compiler diagnostic messages, is 
described.  The method relies on hand selection of a
set of text strings which are common to one or more 
messages.  These phrases are then stored only once. 
The storage technique gives rise to a mathematical 
optimization problem: determine how each message should
use the available phrases to minimize its storage 
requirement.  This problem is nontrivial when phrases
which overlap exist.  However, a dynamic programming 
algorithm is presented which solves the problem in time
which grows linearly with the number of characters 
in the text.  Algorithm 444 applies to this paper.
