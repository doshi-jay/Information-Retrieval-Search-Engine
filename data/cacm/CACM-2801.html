Storage-Efficient Representation of Decimal Data

Usually n decimal digits are represented by
4n bits in computers.  Actually, two BCD digits 
can be compressed optimally and reversibly into 7 bits,
and three digits into 10 bits, by a very simple 
algorithm based on the fixed-length combination of two
variable field-length encodings.  In over half 
of the cases the compressed code results from the conventional
BCD code by simple removal of redundant 
0 bits.  A long decimal message can be subdivided into
three-digit blocks, and separately compressed; 
the result differs from the asymptotic minimum length
by only 0.34 percent.  The hardware requirement 
is small, and the mappings can be done manually.
