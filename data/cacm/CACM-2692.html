Reentrant Polygon Clipping

A new family of clipping algorithms is described.
 These algorithms are able to clip polygons 
against irregular convex plane-faced volumes in three
dimensions, removing the parts of the polygon which 
lie outside the volume.  In two dimensions the algorithms
permit clipping against irregular convex windows. 
 Polygons to be clipped are represented as an ordered
sequence of vertices without repetition of first 
and last, in marked contrast to representation as a
collection of edges as was heretofore the common 
procedure.  Output polygons have an identical format,
with new vertices introduced in sequence to describe 
any newly-cut edge or edges.  The algorithms easily handle
the particularly difficult problem of detecting 
that a new vertex may be required at a corner of the
clipping window.  The algorithms described achieve 
considerable simplicity by clipping separately against
each clipping plane or window boundary.  Code 
capable of clipping the polygon against a single boundary
is reentered to clip against subsequent boundaries. 
 Each such reentrant stage of clipping need store only
two vertex values and may begin its processing 
as soon as the first output vertex from the proceeding
stage is ready.  Because the same code is reentered 
for clipping against subsequent boundaries, clipping
against very complex window shapes is practical. 
 For perspective applications in three dimentions, a six-plane
truncated pyramid is chosen as the clipping 
volume.  The two additional planes parallel to the projection
screen serve to limit the range of depth 
preserved through the projection.  A perspective projection
method which provides for arbitrary view 
angles and depth of field in spite of simple fixed clipping
planes is described.  This method is ideal 
for subsequent hidden-surface computations.
