Autosate

An automated data system analysis technique is
described. The technique is designed to alleviate 
some of the principal problems that beset current analysis-large
data workloads, long span of time between 
project inception and system operational date, the lack
of explicit directions for conducting data system 
analysis and using the results, and the lack of a technique
to control data system changes throughout 
its lifetime. The analysis is geared to determining workload,
relationships and storage characteristics 
of documents in the information network automatically.
