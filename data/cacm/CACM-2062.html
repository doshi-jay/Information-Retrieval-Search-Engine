The Application of Sequential Sampling
to Simulation: An Example Inventory Model

Four different sequential sampling procedures are applied
to the analysis of data generated by a computer simulation
experiment with a multi-item inventory model.  For each procedure
the cost of computer time required to achieve given levels of
statistical precision is calculated.  Also the cost of computer time
using comparable fixed sample size methods is calculated.  The
computer costs of fixed sample size procedures versus
sequential sampling procedures are compared.
