MUX, a Simple Approach to On-Line Computing

An on-line system operating as part of a normal
batch system for the CDC 6600 computer is described. 
 The system, which required one man-year for initial
software implementation, although basically simple,
provides the necessary elements to input and modify files,
submit them for batch execution, and provide 
results at the user's terminal.  A multiplexer designed
and developed as part of the project cost one 
man-year for design and checkout, and $16,000 for parts
and fabrication.  All aspects of the system are 
described, including design criteria, implementation,
cost, overhead, and user reactions.
