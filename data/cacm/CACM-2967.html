A Comparison of Hardware and Software Associative
Memories in the Context of Computer Graphics

The Associative Processing of Line Drawings (APLD)
System utilizes a hardware associative memory 
and creates, modifies, deletes, stores, and retrieves
two-dimensional line drawings consisting of poin ts,
lines, rectangles, and triangles. The APLD functions
were duplicated on the TX-2 computer at M.'s 
Lincoln Laboratory under the LEAP Language and Data
Structure,  A comparison of the hardware approach 
with the software simulation illustrates the advantages
of the hardware associative memory in three areas: 
(1) processing speed, (2) storage requirements, and (3)
flexibility.  The major problem areas of hardware 
associative memory technology, namely input/output
and cost effectiveness, are also addressed.
