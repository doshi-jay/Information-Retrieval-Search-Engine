CONVERT: A High Level Translation
Definition Language for Data Conversion

This paper describes a high level and nonprocedural
translation definition language, CONVERT, 
which provides very powerful and highly flexible data
restructuring capabilities. Its design is based 
on the simple underlying concept of a form which enables
the users to visualize the translation processes, 
and thus makes data translation a much simpler task. 
"CONVERT" has been chosen for conveying the purpose 
of the language and should not be confused with any
other language or program bearing the same name.
