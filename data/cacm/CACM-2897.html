A Case Study of a New Code Generation Technique for Compilers

Recent developments in optimizing techniques
have allowed a new design for compilers to emerge. 
 Such a compiler translates the parsed source code into
lower level code by a sequence of steps.  Each 
step expands higher level statements into blocks of
lower level code and then performs optimizations 
on the result.  Each statement has only one possible
expansion-the task of tailoring this code to take 
advantage of any special cases is done by the optimizations.
 This paper provides evidence that this 
strategy can indeed result in good object code.  The
traditionally difficult PL/I concatenate statement 
was investigated as a detailed example.  A set of fairly
simple optimizations was identified which allow 
the compiler to produce good code. More elaborate optimizations
can further improve the object code. 
 For most contexts of the concatenate statement, the code
produced by a compiler using the expansion-optimization 
strategy described above compares favorably with the
code produced by a conventional PL/I optimizing 
compiler.
