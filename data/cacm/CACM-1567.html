On the Representation of Symmetric Polynomials

Relations are given between certain symmetric
polynomials in the light of the theory of the 
symmetric group.  Such an approach unifies earlier work
and lends insight to previously published work 
by Aaron Booker.  A generalization of Graeffe's root-squaring
technique for the determination of the 
roots of a polynomial is suggested.
