Clarification of Fortran Standards-Second Report

In 1966, after four years of effort, Fortran
became the first programming language standardized 
in the United States.  Since that initial achievement
study and application of the standard specifications 
have revealed the need for maintenance of the standards.
 As the result of work initiated in 1967, an 
initial set of clarifying interpretations was prepared and
this clarification was published in Communications 
of the ACM in May 1969.  That work has continued and
has resulted in the preparation of this second set 
of clarifying interpretations.  The nature of the maintenance
and the new set of corrections to and interpretations 
of the standard specifications are reported.
