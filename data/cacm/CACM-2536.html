Telecommunications Using a Front-End Minicomputer

The use of a front-end minicomputer to provide
varied remote terminal access to a large scale 
computer is considered.  The problems of embedding
telecommunications I/O within an operating system 
are discussed, and it is shown how the decentralization
of intelligence acquired by front-end processing 
vastly simplifies the problem.  A specific implementation is
discussed with emphasis on the main processor-minicomputer 
link, the hardware-software implementation, the effect
of the main processor operating system, and an 
assessment of the advantages over a hard wired line controller.
