A Simulation of Hospital Admission Policy

A study is described which simulates different
admission policies of a large specialized hospital. 
 The objective is to determine better policies for
stabilization of admission and census rates while 
maintaining a reasonably full hospital.  There types of
policies were examined: admission based on percentages 
of discharge rates, discharge rates plus or minus a
constant, and fixed authorizations independent of 
discharge rates.  The last type policy produced more stable
simulated results, and when put into practice, 
improvements were realized.
