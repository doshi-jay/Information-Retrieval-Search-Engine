Performance of Rollback Recovery Systems under Intermittent Failures

A mathematical model of a transaction-oriented
system under intermittent failures is proposed. 
 The system is assumed to operate with a checkpointing
and rollback/recovery method to ensure reliable 
information processing.  The model is used to derive the
principal performance measures, including availability, 
response time, and the system saturation point.
