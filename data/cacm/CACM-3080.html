Proving the Correctness of Heuristically Optimized Code 

A system for proving that programs written
in a high level language are correctly translated 
to a low level language is described.  A primary use of
the system is as a post optimization step in code 
generation.  The low level language programs need not
be generated by a compiler and in fact could be 
hand coded.  Examples of the usefulness of such a system
are given.  Some interesting results are the 
ability to handle programs that implement recursion by
bypassing the start of the program, and the detection 
and pinpointing of a wide class of errors in the low
level language programs.  The examples demonstrate 
that optimization of the genre of this paper can result
in substantially faster operation and the saving 
of memory in terms of program and stack sizes.
