Computer Simulation Of City Traffic

In simulating traffic flow on city streets,
the National Bureau of Standards has used data 
processing techniques to tabulate and make motion pictures
of vehicle movements in the model.  Each vehicle 
is assigned a digital identification giving points of
entry and exit, type of vehicle, desired speed, 
and actual speed, in proportions simulating field data.
 Changes in the model can be made to observe 
their consequences and to determine the ability of a
real street to carry loads expected in the future.
