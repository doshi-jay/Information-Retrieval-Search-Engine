Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks

Ethernet is a branching broadcast communication
system for carrying digital data packets among 
locally distributed computing stations. The packet
transport mechanism provided by Ethernet has been 
used to build systems which can be viewed as either local
computer networks or loosely coupled multiprocessors. 
 An Ethernet's shared communication facility, its Ether,
is a passive broadcast medium with no central 
control.  Coordination of access to the Ether for packet
broadcasts is distributed among the contending 
transmitting stations using controlled statistical arbitration.
 Switching of packets to their destinations 
on the Ether is distributed among the receiving stations
using packet address recognition.  Design principles 
and implementation are described, based on experience
with an operating Ethernet of 100 nodes along a 
kilometer of coaxial cable.  A model for estimating performance
under heavy loads and a packet protocol 
for error controlled communication are included for completeness.
