A Preliminary System for the Design of DBTG Data Structures

The functional approach to database design is
introduced.  In this approach the goal of design 
is to derive a data structure which is capable of supporting
a set of anticipated queries rather than 
a structure which "models the business" in some other
way. An operational computer program is described 
which utilizers the functional approach to design data
structures conforming to the Data Base Task Group 
specifications.  The automatic programming technology
utilized by this program, although typically used 
to generate procedure, is here used to generate declaratives.
