Some Effects of the 6600 Computer on Language Structures*

The problem of compiling efficient 6600 codes
prompted the development of an intermediate language 
reflecting the structure of the machine, that is more
easily manipulated in improving object program 
efficiency.  The subject of this paper is the intermediate
language and methods of manipulating it.  
Compilations of a series of arithmetic statements are
discussed.  It is assumed that all functions and 
exponentials have been removed from these statements,
and replaced by simple variables.  For purposes 
of simplicity the treatment of subscripts is ignored. 
A simplified 6600 structure is presented to illustrate
the compiling method.  Several assumptions are made
for purposes of simplification, although there are 
cases in which the assumptions are violated in the actual machine.
