The Spectra 70/45 Emulator for the RCA 301

The RCA 301 Emulator System is supplied with
the Spectra 70/45 as a reprogramming aid.  It 
allows an RCA 301 object program to be run on the Spectra
70/45 without necessitating changes in the 
RCA 301 object code.  Execution rates are considerably
better than traditional simulation.  The Emulator 
provides an increase in throughput capacity for the
301 user on the Spectra 70/45.  The Emulator makes 
use of both hardware micro-program routines and
software routines to accomplish its function.
