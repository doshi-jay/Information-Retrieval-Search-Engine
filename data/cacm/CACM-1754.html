Dynamic Storage Allocation Systems

In many recent computer system designs, hardware
facilities have been provided for easing the 
problems of storage allocation.  A method of characterizing
dynamic storage allocation systems-according 
to the functional capabilities provided and the underlying
techniques used-is presented.  The basic purpose 
of the paper is to provide a useful perspective from
which the utility of various hardware facilities 
may be assessed.  A brief survey of storage allocation
facilities in several representative computer 
systems is included as an appendix.
