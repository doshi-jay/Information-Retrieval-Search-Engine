Scan Conversion Algorithms for a Cell Organized Raster Display

Raster scan computer graphics with "real time"
character generators have previously been limited 
to alphanumeric characters.  A display has been described
which extends the capabilities of this organization 
to include general graphics.  Two fundamentally different
scan conversion algorithms which have been 
developed to support this display are presented.  One
is most suitable to non-interactive applications 
and the other to interactive applications.  The algorithms
were implemented in Fortran on the CDC 6400 
computer.  Results obtained from the implementations show
that the noninteractive algorithms can significantly 
reduce display file storage requirements at little cost
in execution time over that of a conventional 
raster display.  The interactive algorithm can improve
response time and reduce storage requirements.
