Final Examination Scheduling

A method for scheduling final examinations
to yield a minimal number of student conflicts is 
described.  The "minimization" is achieved by repetitively
evaluating a nonlinear set of equations.  
Imbeded in the process is a random or Monte Carlo selection
of assignments.  As in such heuristic techniques, 
the solution may not be optimum and many solutions
may be found which yield locally minimal results. 
 Computer programs are described and empirical results given.
