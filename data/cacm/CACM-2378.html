An Operating System Based on the Concept of a Supervisory Computer

An operating system which is organized as a
small supervisor and a set of independent processes 
are described.  The supervisor handles I/O with external
devices-the file and directory system-schedules 
active processes and manages memory, handle errors, and
provides a small set of primitive functions which 
it will execute for a process.  A process is able to
specify a request for a complicated action on the 
part of the supervisor (usually a wait on the occurrence
of a compound event in the system) by combining 
these primitives into a "supervisory computer program."
 The part of the supervisor which executes these 
programs may be viewed as a software implemented "supervisory
computer."  The paper develops these concepts 
in detail, outlines the remainder of the supervisor, and
discusses some of the advantages of this approach.
