Computer Science: A Conceptual Framework for Curriculum Planning

Two views of computer science are considered:
a global view which attempts to capture broad 
characteristics of the field and its relationships to
other fields, and a local view which focuses on 
the inner structure of the field.  This structure is presented
in terms of the kinds of knowledge, problems, 
and activities that exist within the discipline, as
well as the relations between them.  An approach 
to curriculum planning in computer science is presented
which is guided by the structure of the field, 
by the fact that change is an important feature of the
situation, and by the expectation that computer
science will continue to increase its working contacts with other disciplines.
