An Extended Arithmetic Package

In many fields, for example algebraic number
theory, arithmetic must be carried out to a degree 
of precision which exceeds the normal hardware capacity
of most machines.  In such cases, an extended 
arithmetic package provides a comprehensive and easy-to-use
way of performing such arithmetic.  Such 
a package was coded for the IBM 7090.  In discussing
the general problems associated with the design 
of an extended arithmetic package, specific reference is made to this program.
