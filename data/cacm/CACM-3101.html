The SL5 Procedure Mechanism

This paper describes an integrated procedure
mechanism that permits procedures to be used as 
recursive functions or as coroutines.  This integration
is accomplished by treating procedures and their 
activation records (called environments) as data objects
and by decomposing procedure invocation into 
three separate components at the source-language level.
 In addition, argument binding is under the control 
of the programmer, permitting the definition of various
methods of argument transmission in the source 
language itself.  The resulting procedure mechanism,which
is part of the SL5 programming language, is 
well suited to goal-oriented problems and to other problems
that are more readily programmed by using 
coroutines. Several examples are given.
