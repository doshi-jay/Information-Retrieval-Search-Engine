An Algorithm for Generating Root Locus Diagrams

A technique for using a digital computer to
draw both ordinary and time-lag root locus diagrams 
is described.  Ordinary diagrams are drawn much faster
and more accurately than ever before.  Time-lag 
diagrams, which had been impossible to obtain, are drawn
with the same speed and accuracy as ordinary 
diagrams.
