A Computer User-Oriented System

A computer language system has been developed
which makes possible fast preparation of management 
reports, regardless of computational complexity or format
variety.  Costs are sufficiently low so that 
individually tailored reports can be prepared for every
manager.  The system requires initial preparation 
of large data banks containing data in elementary form.
 Use of two special languages, EXTRACT and MATRAN, 
permits selective extraction of any data subset, efficient
processing through any computational sequence, 
and flexible presentation of results in either tabular
or graphical form.  Matrix algebra is used as 
a fundamental vehicle for accomplishing both manipulation and computation.
