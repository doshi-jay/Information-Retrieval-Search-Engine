Expanding the Editing Function In Language Data Processing

In automatic abstracting, citation indexing,
mechanical translation and other such procedures, 
editing is required whenever the automatic method leaves
something to be desired.  This paper discusses 
the economy of editing as a function of the amount of condensation
of text in language processing operations, 
and then contends that editing can be regarded as an
opportunity rather than as an unwelcome necessity. 
 "Heavy editing," which goes beyond mere correction
and improvement of computer output, is exemplified 
by the use of a concordance in preparing a survey article
or lecture.  Other opportunities for heavy 
editing are described, chief among them being interpretation and
expansion of computer output in such 
processes as factor analysis.  Applications are described,
such processes as factor analysis.  Applications 
are described, such as the quick, unbiased evaluation
of a large volume of incoming mail or telegrams, 
yielding summary reports not possible for either
humans or computers to produce alone.
