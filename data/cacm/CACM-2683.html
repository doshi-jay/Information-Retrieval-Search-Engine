The Synthesis of Loop Predicates

Current methods for mechanical program verification
require a complete predicate specification 
on each loop.  Because this is tedious and error prone,
producing a program with complete, correct predicates 
is reasonably difficult and would be facilitated by machine
assistance.  This paper discusses techniques 
for mechanically synthesizing loop predicates.  Two classes
of techniques are considered: (1) heuristic 
methods which derive loop predicates from boundary conditions
and/or partially specified inductive assertions: 
(2) extraction methods which use input predicates and
appropriate weak interpretations to obtain certain 
classes of loop predicates by an evaluation on the weak interpretation.
