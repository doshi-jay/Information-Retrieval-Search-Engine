Shallow Binding in Lisp 1.5

Shallow binding is a scheme which allows the
value of a variable to be accessed in a bounded 
amount of computation.  An elegant model for shallow binding
in  Lisp 1.5 is presented in which context-switching 
is an environment tree transformation called rerooting.
 Rerooting is completely general and reversible, 
and is optional in the sense that a Lisp 1.5 interpreter
will operate correctly whether or not rerooting 
is invoked one very context change.   Since rerooting
leaves assoc [v, a] invariant, for all variables 
v and all environments a, the programmer can have access
to a rerooting primitive, shallow[], which gives 
him dynamic control over whether accesses are shallow or
deep, and which affects only the speed of execution 
of a program, not its semantics.  In addition, multiple
processes can be active in the same environment 
structure, so long as rerooting is an indivisible operation.
 Finally, the concept of rerooting is shown 
to combine the concept of shallow binding in Lisp with
Dijkstra's display for Algol and hence is a general 
model for shallow binding.
