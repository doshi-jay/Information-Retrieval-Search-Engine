The Evolution of the Sperry Univac 1100
Series: A His tory, Analysis, and Projection

The 1100 series systems are Sperry Univac's
large-scale main frame computer systems.  Beginning 
with the 1107 in 1962, the 1100 series has progressed
through a succession of eight compatible computer 
models to the latest system, the 1100/80, introduced
in 1977.  The 1100 series hardware architecture 
is based on a 36-bit word, ones complement structure
which obtains one operand from storage and one from 
a high-speed register, or two operands from high-speed
registers.  The 1100 Operating System is designed 
to support a symmetrical multiprocessor configuration
simultaneously providing multiprogrammed batch, 
timesharing, and transaction environments.
