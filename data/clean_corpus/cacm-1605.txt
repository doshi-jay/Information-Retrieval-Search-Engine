an experimental comparison of time sharing and batch processing the effectiveness for program development of the mit compatible time-sharing system ctss was compared with that of the ibm ibsys batch-processing system by means of a statistically designed experiment an identical set of four programming problems was assigned to each of a group of four programming subjects influences external to the systems such as the sequence of problem solution and programmer and problem characteristics were specified as design factors in the experiment data was obtained for six variables eg programmer time computer time elapsed time etc which were considered to be definitive of system effectiveness and analysis of variance techniques were employed to estimate system differences in these variables after differences due to the design factors had been eliminated statistical analysis of the experimental results provided strong evidence of important system differences as well as a critique of the experimental design itself with implications for further experimentation cacm may 1967 schatzoff m tsao r wiig r ca670501 jb february 28 1978 11:09 am
