an efficient composite formula for multidimensional quadrature a 2s+1-point second-degree quadrature formula for integration over an s-dimensional hyper-rectangle is presented all but one of the points lie on the surface with weights of opposite sign attached to points on opposite faces when a large volume is subdivided into congruent rectangular subdivisions only one point is required in each interior subdivision to achieve second-degree accuracy cacm january 1964 thacher jr h c ca640109 jb march 10 1978 5:28 am
