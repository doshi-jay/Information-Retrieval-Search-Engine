automatic segmentation of cyclic program structures based on connectivity and processor timing time-shared multiprogrammed and overlayed batch systems frequently require segmentation of computer programs into discrete portions these program portions are transferred between executable and peripheral storage whenever necessary segmentation of program s in a manner that reduces the frequency of such transfers is the subject of this paper segmentation techniques proposed by c v ramamoorthy are subject to limitations that arise when the preferred segment size is not compatible with the physical restrictions imposed by the available computing equipment a generalization of ramamoorthys suggestions is made in order to allow their application when circumstances are other than ideal cacm january 1970 lowe t c automatic segmentation cyclic program structures loops paging multiprogramming loaders assemblers compilers time-sharing program connectivity 4.19 5.24 5.32 ca700101 jb february 14 1978 2:20 pm
