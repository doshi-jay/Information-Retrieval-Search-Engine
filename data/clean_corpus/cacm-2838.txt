analysis of an algorithm for real time garbage collection a real time garbage collection system avoids suspending the operations of a list processor for the long times that garbage collection normally requires by performing garbage collection on a second processor in parallel with list processing operations or on a single processor time-shared with them algorithms for recovering discarded list structures in this manner are presented and analyzed to determine sufficient conditions under which the list processor never needs to wait on the collector these techniques are shown to require at most twice as much processing power as regular garbage collectors if they are used efficiently the average behavior of the program is shown to be very nearly equal to the worst-case performance so that the sufficient conditions are also suitable for measuring the typical behavior of the algorithm cacm september 1976 wadler p l garbage collection storage reclamation list processing lisp time-sharing multiprocessing parallel processing real time data structures analysis of algorithms 3.69 3.89 4.19 4.29 4.32 4.34 4.9 5.25 ca760901 jb january 4 1978 9:57 am
