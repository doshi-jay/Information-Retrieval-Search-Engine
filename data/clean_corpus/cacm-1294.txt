note on triple-precision floating-point arithmetic with 132-bit numbers in a recent paper gregory and raney described a technique for double-precision floating-point arithmetic a similar technique can be developed for triple-precision floating-point arithmetic and it is the purpose of this note to describe this technique only the multiplication and the division algorithms are described since the addition-subtraction algorithm can be obtained by a trivial modification of the algorithm in gregorys and raneys paper cacm march 1965 ikebe y ca650313 jb march 7 1978 5:54 pm
