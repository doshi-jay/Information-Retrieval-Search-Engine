interpolation search -a log logn search interpolation search is a method of retrieving a desired record by key in an ordered file by using the value of the key and the statistical distribution of the keys it is shown that on the average log logn file accesses are required to retrieve a key assuming that the n keys are uniformly distributed the number of extra accesses is also estimated and shown to be very low the same holds if the cumulative distribution function of the keys is known computational experiments confirm these results cacm july 1978 perl y itai a avni h average number of accesses binary search database interpolation search retrieval searching uniform distribution 4.4 4.6 5.25 ca780704 dh february 7 1979 4:50 pm
