optimum merging from mass storage an algorithm is displayed which yields the merge orders such that the total read time defined to be the sum of seek time plus data-transfer time is minimized for a sort using mass storage the analysis is parameterized in terms of the ratio of seek time to the time it takes to fill available core with records and the file size in units of core lengths and thus it can be applied to any conventional cpu/mass storage combination an explicit formula for total read time is derived in terms of the parameters which correlates very well with the total read time calculated using the optimum merge orders yielded by the algorithm the formula involves the roots of a simple transcendental equation a short table of these roots is included numerical results are graphically displayed for a wide range of the parameters it is found that the normalized read time for optimum merging on a given hardware configuration is proportional to the file length times the logarithm of the file length cacm december 1970 black n a sorting merging optimum merging mass storage sort timing drum-merging access time 3.37 4.49 5.31 ca701207 jb february 9 1978 3:18 pm
