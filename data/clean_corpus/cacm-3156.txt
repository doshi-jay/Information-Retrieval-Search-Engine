computing connected components on parallel computers we present a parallel algorithm which uses n2 processors to find the connected components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time olog2n an olog2n time bound also can be achieved using only n$n$log2n processors the algorithm can be used to find the transitive closure of a symmetric boolean matrix we assume that the processors have access to a common memory simultaneous access to the same location is permitted for fetch instructions but not for store instructions cacm august 1979 hirschberg d chandra a sarwate d graph theory parallel processing algorithms transitive closure connected component 5.25 5.32 6.22 ca790802 db january 4 1980 12:18 pm
