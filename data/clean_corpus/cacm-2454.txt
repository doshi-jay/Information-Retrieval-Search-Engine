computational algorithms for closed queueing networks with exponential servers methods are presented for computing the equilibrium distribution of customers in closed queueing networks with exponential servers expressions for various marginal distributions are also derived the computational algorithms are based on two-dimensional iterative techniques which are highly efficient and quite simple to implement implementation considerations such as storage allocation strategies and order of evaluation are examined in some detail cacm september 1973 buzen j p queueing theory queueing networks equilibrium distributions steady state distributions 5.12 5.5 8.1 8.3 ca730901 jb january 23 1978 10:07 am
