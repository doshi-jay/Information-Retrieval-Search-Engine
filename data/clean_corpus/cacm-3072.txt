feedback coupled resource allocation policies in the multiprogramming multiprocessor computer system model studies of some integrated feedback-driven scheduling systems for multiprogrammed multiprocessor computer systems are presented the basic control variables used are the data-flow rates for the processes executing on the cpu the model systems feature simulated continuous-flow and preempt-resume scheduling of input-output activity attention is given to the amount of memory resource required for effective processing of the i/o activity buffer space assignment the model studies used both distribution-driven and trace-driven techniques even relatively simple dynamic schedulers are shown to improve system performance as measured by user cpu time over that given by optimal or near-optimal static schedulers imbeded in identical system structures and workload environments the improvement is greatest under a heavy i/o demand workload cacm august 1978 brice r browne j integrated schedulers feedback scheduling multiprogramming systems i/o system scheduling 4.32 4.35 ca780806 dh february 5 1979 4:01 pm
