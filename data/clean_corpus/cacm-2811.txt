structural pattern recognition of carotid pulse waves using a general waveform parsing system a general waveform parsing system with application to structural pattern recognition of carotid pulse waves is described the carotid arterial pulse wave is of medical importance because of variation in its structure induced by arterial aging and cardiovascular disease the syntax-driven waveform analysis system has been applied with good results to these pulse waves to detect and measure structural variations the waveform parsing system is modeled on a compiler-compiler system and allows the user to enter application specific information as data it is thus general enough to be applicable to other waveforms cacm december 1976 stockman g kanal l kyle m c structural pattern recognition parsing waveform analysis pulse waves 3.12 3.34 3.63 4.12 ca761204 jb january 3 1978 1:43 pm
