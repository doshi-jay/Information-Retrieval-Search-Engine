symbolic execution and program testing this paper describes the symbolic execution of programs instead of supplying the normal inputs to a program eg numbers one supplies symbols representing arbitrary values the execution proceeds as in a normal execution except that values may be symbolic formulas over the input symbols the difficult yet interesting issues arise during the symbolic execution of conditional branch type statements a particular system called effigy which provides symbolic execution for program testing and debugging is also described it interpretively executes programs written in a simple pl/i style programming language it includes many standard debugging features the ability to manage and to prove things about symbolic expressions a simple program testing manager and a program verifier a brief discussion of the relationship between symbolic execution and program proving is also included cacm july 1976 king j c symbolic execution program testing program debugging program proving program verification symbolic interpretation 4.13 5.21 5.24 ca760703 jb january 4 1978 12:59 pm
