a unifying approach to scheduling this paper presents a scheme for classifying scheduling algorithms based on an abstract model of a scheduling system which formalizes the notion of priority various classes of scheduling algorithms are defined and related to existing algorithms a criterion for the implementation efficiency of an algorithm is developed and results in the definition of time-invariant algorithms which include most of the commonly implemented ones for time-invariant algorithms the dependence of processing rates on priorities is derived the abstract model provides a framework for implementing flexible schedulers in real operating systems the policy-driven scheduler of bernstein and sharp is discussed as an example of such an implementation cacm july 1977 ruschitzka m fabry r s scheduling algorithms scheduling models priority operating systemsprocessor sharing implementation efficiency 4.31 4.32 4.34 4.35 8.1 ca770702 jb december 28 1977 12:32 pm
