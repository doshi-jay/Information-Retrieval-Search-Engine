an algorithm for reduction of operator strength a simple algorithm which uses an indexed temporary table to perform reduction of operator strength in strongly connected regions is presented several extensions including linear function test replacement are discussed these algorithms should fit well into an integrated package of local optimization algorithms cacm november 1977 cocke j compilers optimization of compiled code program analysis operator strength reduction test replacement strongly connected region 4.12 5.24 5.32 ca771112 jb december 27 1977 6:34 am
