a microprogrammed implementation of euler on ibm system/360 model 30 an experimental processing system for the algorithmic language euler has been implemented in microprogramming on an ibm system/360 model 30 using a second read-only storage unit the system consists of a microprogrammed compiler and a microprogrammed string language interpreter and of an i/o control program written in 360 machine language the system is described and results are given in terms of microprogram and main storage space required and compiler and interpreter performance obtained the role of microprogramming is stressed which opens a new dimension in the processing of interpretive code the structure and content of a higher level language can be matched by an appropriate interpretive language which can be executed efficiently by microprograms on existing computer hardware cacm september 1967 weber h ca670904 jb february 27 1978 3:44 pm
