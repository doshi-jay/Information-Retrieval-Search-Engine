a genealogy of control structures the issue of program control structures has had a history of heated controversy to put this issue on a solid footing this paper reviews numerous theoretical results on control structures and explores their practical implications the classic result of bohm and jacopini on the theoretical completeness of if-then-else and while-do is discussed several recent ideas on control structures are then explored these include a review of various other control structures results on time/space limitations and theorems relating the relative power of control structures under notions of equivalence in conclusion the impact of theoretical results on the practicing programmer and the importance of one-in one-out control structures as operational abstractions are discussed it is argued further that there is insufficient evidence to warrant more than if-then-else while-do and their variants cacm november 1975 ledgard h f marcotty m structured programming control structures goto statements language design pascal 4.2 5.24 ca751103 jb january 6 1978 9:53 am
