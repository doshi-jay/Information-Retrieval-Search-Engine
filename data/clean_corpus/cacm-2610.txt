gauss harmonic interpolation formulas let r be an open bounded simply connected region in the xy-plane and let xy be a point in r assuming r is starlike with respect to xy we discuss a method for computing gauss harmonic interpolation formulas for r and the point xy such formulas approximate a harmonic function at xy in terms of a linear combination of its values at certain selected points on the boundary of r such formulas are useful for approximating the solution of the dirichlet problem for r cacm august 1974 stroud a h interpolation quadrature harmonic interpolation harmonic quadrature dirichlet problem 5.13 5.16 5.17 ca740814 jb january 17 1978 9:23 am
