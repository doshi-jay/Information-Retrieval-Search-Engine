a code for non-numeric information processing applications in online systems a code has been specifically designed to simplify the internal information processing operations within an online computer system with respect to non-numeric applications and to maximize the transfer rate of the information channel linking the system and the system user the code has direct application to problems in area such as information retrieval document classification computer-aided teaching and text editing this code called ipc information processing code is an 8-bit code set constructed so that 7 6 5 and 4-bit subsets can be easily derived from the basic set the code set is organized so that simple binary operations can distinguish between the numeric alphabetic special symbol and control character codes the number of usable characters within the basic set size may be expanded either by use of escape codes included in the set or by suitable interpretation of otherwise unassigned codes on the basis of the requirements of local environments cacm january 1967 morenoff e mclean j b ca670103 jb march 1 1978 9:05 am
