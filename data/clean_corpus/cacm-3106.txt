a fast algorithm for copying list structures an algorithm is presented for copying an arbitrarily linked list structure into a block of contiguous storage locations without destroying the original list apart from a fixed number of program variables no auxiliary storage such as a stack is used the algorithm needs no mark bits and operates in linear time it is shown to be significantly faster than fishers algorithm the fastest previous linear-time algorithm for the same problem its speed comes mainly from its efficient list-traversal technique which folds the processing stack into the structure being built and from its classification of list cells into nine types which enables processing operations to be optimized for each type cacm may 1978 clark d list copying lisp space complexity constant workspace 4.34 4.49 5.25 ca780501 dh february 26 1979 3:25 pm
