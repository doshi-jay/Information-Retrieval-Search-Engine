performance of systems used for data transmission transfer rate of information bits -an asa tutorial standard information thruput as a characteristic of systems performance is discussed this discussion includes the pertinent aspects of information transfer of determination of transfer rate of information bits trib of residual errors and of standard measurement conditions the paper also presents an orderly arrangement of characteristics and parameters that affect information thruput and some examples on procedures for determining a thruput rate in terms of trib it concludes that a performance characteristic involving information rate can best be expressed as the trib in conjunction with the residual error rate cacm may 1965 ca650504 jb march 7 1978 3:10 pm
