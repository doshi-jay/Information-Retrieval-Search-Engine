fast parallel sorting algorithms a parallel bucket-sort algorithm is presented that requires time olog n and the use of n processors the algorithm makes use of a technique that requires more space than the product of processors and time a realistic model is used model is used in which no memory contention is permitted a procedure is also presented to sort n numbers in time ok log n using n 1 + 1/k processors for k an arbitrary integer the model of computation for this procedure permits simultaneous fetches from the same memory location cacm august 1978 hirschberg d parallel processing sorting algorithms bucket sort 3.74 4.34 5.25 5.31 ca780803 dh february 7 1979 10:25 am
