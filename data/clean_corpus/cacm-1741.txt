brad the brookhaven raster display a multiconsole computer display system has been designed that provides very rich displays at low unit cost each brad brookhaven raster display console can plot tens of thousands of points or up to 4000 characters at 30 frames per second after an initial display system investment of $50,000 each display with teletype costs less than $3,000 the technique employed is that of programmatically generating a binary image of the desired display in a computer the image is written on a rotating drum memory independent read heads continuously display the picture which is generated by swept horizontal lines a standard tv monitor serves as the display device the technique has two drawbacks a computer must compute any image to be displayed also the pointing interaction is more difficult this is because the pointing function gives only the coordinates of the point on the screen the inverse of the map generation process is required to calculate the coordinates of the point on the screen the inverse of the map generation process is required to calculate the coordinates at the selected point in the input space cacm june 1968 ophir d rankowitz s shepherd b j spinrad r j computer display computer graphics computer raster display tv display console digital tv display swept raster computer display swept raster tv computer display tv graphics terminal multiconsole computer graphics inexpensive graphic terminal 2.0 4.49 6.35 ca680604 jb february 22 1978 4:35 pm
