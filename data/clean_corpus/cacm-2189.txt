generation of rosary permutations expressed in hamiltonian circuits systematic generation of a specific class of permutations fundamental to scheduling problems is described in a nonoriented complete graph with n vertices hamitonian circuits equivalent to .5n  1 specific permutations of n elements termed rosary permutations can be defined each of them corresponds to two circular permutations which mirror-image each other and is generated successively by a number system covering 34n-1 sets of edges every set of edges ek 1  ek  k 3  k  n-1 is determined recursively by constructing a hamiltonian circuit with k vertices from a hamiltonian circuit with k-1 vertices starting with the hamiltonian circuit of 3 vertices the basic operation consists of transposition of a pair of adjacent vertices where the position of the pair in the permutation is determined by ek two algorithms treating the same example for five vertices are presented it is very easy to derive all possible n permutations from the .5n  1  rosary permutations be cycling the permutations and by taking them in the reverse order-procedures which can be performed fairly efficiently by computer cacm june 1971 harada k permutation graph theory scheduling combinatorial algebra 5.32 5.39 ca710601 jb february 3 1978 1:55 pm
