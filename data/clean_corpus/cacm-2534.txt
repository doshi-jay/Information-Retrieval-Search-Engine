design and implementation of a diagnostic compiler for pl/i pl/c is a compiler for a dialect for pl/i the design objective was to provide a maximum degree of diagnostic assistance in a batch processing environment for the most part this assistance is implicit and is provided automatically by the compiler the most remarkable characteristic of pl/c is its perseverance-it completes translation of every program submitted and continues execution until a user-established error limit is reached this requires that the compiler repair errors encountered during both translation and execution and the design of pl/c is dominated by this consideration pl/c also introduces several explicit user-controlled facilities for program testing to accommodate these extensions to pl/i without abandoning compatibility with ibm compiler pl/c permits pseudo comments-constructions whose contents can optionally be considered either source test or comment in spite of the diagnostic effort pl/c is a fast and efficient processor it effectively demonstrates that compilers can provide better diagnostic assistance than is customarily offered even when a sophisticated source language is employed and that this assistance need not be prohibitively costly cacm march 1973 conway r w wilcox t r compilers debugging pl/i programming languages 1.5 4.12 4.42 ca730305 jb january 24 1978 10:45 am
