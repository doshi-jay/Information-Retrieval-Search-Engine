a syntactic algorithm for peak detection in waveforms with applications to cardiography peaks in a digitized waveform are detected by an algorithm incorporating piecewise linear approximation and tabular parsing techniques several parameters serve to identify the waveform context enabling accurate measurement of peak amplitude duration and shape the algorithm is of sufficient speed to allow on-line real-time processing an example of its application is demonstrated on an electrocardiogram cacm may 1975 horowitz s l peak detection digitized waveform piecewise linear approximation context-free grammar bottom-up parsing electrocardiogram 3.12 3.24 3.34 3.63 4.19 5.13 5.23 ca750513 jb january 9 1978 2:18 pm
