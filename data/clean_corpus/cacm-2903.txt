improving programs by the introduction of recursion a new technique of program transformation called recursion in troduction is described and applied to two algorithms which solve pattern matching problems by using recursion in troduction algorithms which manipulate a stack are first translated into recursive algorithms in which no stack operations occur these algorithms are then subjected to a second transformation a method of recursion elimination called tabulation to produce programs with a very efficient running time in particular it is shown how the fast linear pattern matching algorithm of knuth morris and pratt can be derived in a few steps from a simple nonlinear stack algorithm cacm november 1977 bird r s program transformation optimization of programs recursion elimination pattern matching algorithms stacks computational induction 4.0 4.2 5.20 5.24 5.25 ca771113 jb december 27 1977 6:29 am
