a general formulation of storage allocation formalization of a general computer storage allocation process is attempted with a given computer m is associated a fictitious computer m essentially identical to m except in respect to possession of unbounded primary storage mappings of the total storage set internal and external of m into the direct address set of m are introduced a program sequence p for m is termed m-admissible relative to a specific execution time period if there is a mapping underwhich p and its effective data referents are all located in the direct address set of m storage allocation is considered as a process of establishing for an arbitrary m program a sequence of mappings a decoupling of the program into m-admissible subprograms and a linking set of interludes an existence proof in terms of a completely interpretive m program as indicated some special cases are discussed various restrictions on generality of m programs are considered under which more practical realization of allocation processes becomes tractable cacm october 1961 roberts jr a e ca611003 jb march 16 1978 1:22 pm
