conversion of decision tables to computer programs by rule mark techniques the rule mask technique is one method of converting limited entry decision tables to computer programs recent discussion suggest that in many circumstances it is to be preferred to the technique of constructing networks or trees a drawback of the technique as hitherto presented is its liability to produce object programs of longer run time than necessary in this paper a modification of the technique is discussed which takes into account both rule frequencies and the relative times for evaluating conditions this can materially improve object program run time cacm november 1966 king p j h ca661104 jb march 2 1978 3:41 pm
