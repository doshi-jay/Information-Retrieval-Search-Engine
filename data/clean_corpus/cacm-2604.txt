an interactive graphic display for region partitioning by linear programming using linear programming an interactive graphic display system has been implemented to solve the region design problem of partitioning a region into n nonoverlapping subregions in such a way that their areas are in specified proportions and that the total cost of servicing them is a minimum in a conversational manner a user can easily obtain different partitionings by specifying and modifying the boundary the service centers locations the area proportions and the cost functions examples are included cacm september 1974 cheung t interactive graphic display region partitioning area specification linear programming 5.41 8.2 8.3 ca740904 jb january 17 1978 8:56 am
