mechanization of tedious algebra the newcomb operators of planetary theory a computer program has been written to generate tables of formulas for the newcomb operators of planetary theory the newcomb operators are expressed as polynomials in two variables one of which stands for a simple differential operator and the other for an arbitrary integer the polynomials are generated by a recurrence scheme the program is coded in fortran using simple array manipulation techniques to perform the algebraic operations formulas for over 100 newcomb operators have been produced by the program and typeset photographically on an s-560 photon system cacm january 1965 gerard j m izsak i g barnett m p ca650103 jb march 8 1978 2:59 pm
