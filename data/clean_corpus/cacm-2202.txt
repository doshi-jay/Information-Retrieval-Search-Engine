dynamic microprogramming processor organization and programming a dynamically microprogrammed processor is characterized by a small 4^k 64-bit word read-write micro storage the access time of this storage is similar to the cycle time of the machine 50-100 nsec this microstorage is used to contain both data and subroutines the micro instructions in such a processor differ from the conventional in that they perform only purely combinatorial operations sequencing is under the control of the microinstruction the presence of the read-write microstorage permits a more flexible assignment of resources than the read-only storage in particular the processor developed in this paper stresses the simultaneous operation within the microinstruction of the adder shifter masker and testing facilities of the processor a microassembly language is developed and the overhead involved in subroutine linkages is analyzed the efficiency of a flexible software linkage scheme is examined as to its overhead for various subroutine characteristics finally three examples of problem-oriented programming are considered and the resulting coding is compared against a system/360 assembly language version with the technology normalized cacm april 1971 tucker a b flynn m j microprogrammingread-write microstorage subroutine linkage execution speed 6.2 ca710403 jb february 3 1978 3:58 pm
