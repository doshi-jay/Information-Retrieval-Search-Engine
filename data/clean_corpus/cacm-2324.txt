management science a view from nonlinear programming a brief history of integer and continuous nonlinear programming is presented as well as the current obstacles to practical use of these mathematical programming techniques it is forecast that the useful contributions to nonlinear programming actually made in the next few years are more likely to be consolidations than theoretical breakthroughs these contributions are likely to be the documentation of standard test problems construction of user oriented software and comparisons of currently known algorithms to demonstrate which techniques are best for specific problems cacm july 1972 shanno d f weil r l integer programming linear programming mathematical programming nonlinear programming quadratic programming management science operations research algorithms 5.41 8.3 ca720704 jb january 30 1978 3:14 pm
