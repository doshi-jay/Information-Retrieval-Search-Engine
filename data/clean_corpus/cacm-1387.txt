solution of systems of polynomial equations by elimination the elimination procedure as described by williams has been coded in lisp and formac and used in solving systems of polynomial equations it is found that the method is very effective in the case of small systems where it yields all solutions without the need for initial estimates the method by itself appears in appropriate however in the solution of large systems of equation due to the explosive growth in the intermediate equations and the hazards which arise when the coefficients are truncated a comparison is made with difficulties found in other problems in non-numerical mathematics such as symbolic integration and simplification cacm august 1966 moses j ca660811 jb march 2 1978 7:11 pm
