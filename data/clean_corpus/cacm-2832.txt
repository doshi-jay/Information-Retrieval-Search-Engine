faster retrieval from context trees corrigendum context trees provide a convenient way of storing data which is to be viewed as a hierarchy of contexts this note presents an algorithm which improves on previous context tree retrieval algorithms it is based on the observation that in typical uses context changes are infrequent relative to retrievals so that data can be cached to speed up retrieval a retrieval is started from the position of the previous retrieval and auxiliary structures are built up to make the search rapid algorithms for addition and deletion of data and for garbage collection are outlined cacm september 1976 wegbreit b context trees frame problem variable bindings data structures 3.69 3.74 4.10 ca760907 jb january 4 1978 8:49 am
