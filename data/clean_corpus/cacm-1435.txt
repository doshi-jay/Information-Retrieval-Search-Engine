design of computer simulation experiments for industrial systems the aim of this paper is to provide background information on the existing literature on experimental design techniques which may be applicable to the design of computer simulation experiments for industrial systems although major emphasis is placed on analysis of variance techniques three other techniques of data analysis are considered-multiple ranking procedures sequential sampling and spectral analysis the paper treats four specific experimental design problems and several techniques for solving them the four experimental design problems are 1 the problem of stochastic convergence 2 the problem of factor selection 3 the problem of motive and 4 the many response problem cacm may 1966 burdick d s naylor t h ca660502 jb march 3 1978 10:20 am
