a time and space efficient garbage compaction algorithm given an area of storage containing scattered marked nodes of differing sizes one may wish to rearrange them into a compact mass at one end of the area while revising all pointers to marked nodes to show their new locations an algorithm is described here which accomplishes this task in linear time relative to the size of the storage area and in a space of the order of one bit for each pointer the algorithm operates by reversibly encoding the situation that a collection of locations point to a single location by a linear list emanating from the pointed-to location passing through the pointing locations and terminating with the pointed-to locations transplanted contents cacm august 1978 morris f garbage collection compaction compact ification storage reclamation storage allocation record structures relocation list processing free storage pointers data structures 4.34 4.49 5.32 ca780804 dh february 7 1979 10:16 am
