approximate solution of initial boundary wave equation problems by boundary-value techniques a new boundary-value technique is proposed for the treatment of initial-boundary-value problems for linear and mildly nonlinear wave equations several illustrative examples are offered to demonstrate the ease with which the method can be applied cacm november 1968 greenspan d initial-boundary-value problem wave equation boundary-value technique 5.15 5.17 ca681106 jb february 21 1978 2:48 pm
