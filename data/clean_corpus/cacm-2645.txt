two languages for estimating program efficiency two languages enabling their users to estimate the efficiency of computer programs are presented the program whose efficiency one wishes to estimate is written in the first language a go-to-less programming language which includes most of the features of algol 60 the second language consists of interactive commands enabling its users to provide additional information about the program written in the first language and to output results estimating its efficiency processors for the two languages are also described the first processor is a syntax-directed translator which compiles a program into a symbolic formula representing the execution time for that program the sound processor is a set of procedures for that program the second processor is a set of procedures for algebraic manipulation which can be called by the user to operate on the formula produced by the first processor examples of the usage of the two languages are included the limitations of the present system its relation to knuths work on the analysis of algorithms and some of the directions for further research are also discussed cacm june 1974 ccohen j zuckerman c programming languages syntax-directed translation symbolic manipulation program efficiency analysis of algorithms 4.12 4.20 5.24 5.25 ca740601 jb january 17 1978 3:48 pm
