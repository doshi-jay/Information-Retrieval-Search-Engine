order-n correction for regular languages a method is presented for calculating a string b belonging to a given regular language l which is nearest in number of edit operations to a given input string a b is viewed as a reasonable correction for the possibly erroneous string a where a was originally intended to be a string of l the calculation of b by the method presented requires time proportional to a the number of characters in a the method should find applications in information retrieval artificial intelligence and spelling correction systems cacm may 1974 wagner r a error correction regular languages regular events finite state automata compiler error recovery spelling correction string best match problem correction corrector errors nondeterministic finite-state automata 4.12 4.20 5.22 5.23 5.42 ca740503 jb january 17 1978 4:26 pm
