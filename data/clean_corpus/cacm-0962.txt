double-precision squares root for the cdc-3600 in january of 1960 the late hans j maehly completed a summary of approximations to the elementary functions for the cdc-1604 computer the approximations and techniques suggested by maehly are equally applicable to the second large computer in the cdc line the 3600 unlike the 1604 however the 3600 has built-in double-precision floating-point arithmetic the present work largely inspired by the successes of maehly and his associates concerns the extension of one of maehlys ideas to a double-precision subroutine for the 3600 cacm december 1964 cody w j ca641209 jb march 9 1978 3:31 pm
