storage utilization in a memory hierarchy when storage assignment is performed by a hashing algorithm the utilization of storage is studied in a two-level memory hierarchy the first storage level which is the fast store is divided into a number of storage areas when an entry is to be filed in the hierarchy a hashing algorithm will attempt to place the entry into one of these areas if this particular area is full then the entry will be placed into the slower second-level store even though other areas in the first-level store may have space available given the n entries have been filed in the entire hierarchy an expression is derived for the expected number of entries filed in the first-level storehis expression gives a measure of how effectively the first-level store is being used by means of examples storage utilization is then studied as a function of the hashing algorithm the number of storage areas into which the first-level store is divided and the total size of the first-level store cacm march 1971 williams j g hashing algorithms memory allocation memory hierarchy memory utilization storage allocation storage hierarchy storage utilization 3.74 4.3 ca710304 jb february 3 1978 4:37 pm
