on shrinking binary picture patterns a parallel processing algorithm for shrinking binary patterns to obtain single isolated elements one for each pattern is presented this procedure may be used for counting patterns on a matrix and a hardware implementation of the algorithm using large scale integrated technology is envisioned the principal features of this method are the very small window employed two-by-two elements the parallel nature of the process and the possibility of shrinking any pattern regardless of the complexity of its configuration problems regarding merging and disconnection of patterns during the process as well as the determination of the maximum number of steps necessary to obtain a single isolated element from a pattern are reviewed and discussed an analogy with a neural network description in terms of mcculloch-pitts neurons is presented cacm january 1972 levialdi s counting binary patterns shrinking parallel processing multiple connected pictures 3.63 ca720102 jb february 1 1978 9:43 am
