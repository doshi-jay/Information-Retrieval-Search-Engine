regular right part grammars and their parsers this paper in troduces an alternative to context-free grammars called regular right part rrp grammars which resemble pascal syntax diagrams formally rrp grammars have production right parts which are nondeterministic finite state machines fsms and as a special case regular expressions since these can be converted to fsms rrp grammars describe the syntax of programming languages more concisely and more understandably than is possible with cf grammars also in troduced is a class of parsers rrp lrm k parsers which includes the cf lrk parsers and provides the same advantages informally an rrp lrm k parser can determine the right end of each handle by considering at most k symbols to the right of the handle and the left end after the right end has been found by considering at most m symbols to the left of the handle a mechanism for determining the left end is required because there is no bound on the length of the handle cacm october 1977 lalonde w r finite state machines automata regular expressions syntax diagramslrk grammars parser construction parsing programming languages language generation formal definition compilers translators scanners 4.2 5.21 5.23 ca771005 jb december 27 1977 11:01 am
