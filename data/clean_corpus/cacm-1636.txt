invariant imbeding and the numerical integration of boundary-value problems for unstable linear systems of ordinary differential equations in such diverse areas as radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres and optimal guidance and control two-point boundary-value problems for unstable systems arise greatly complicating the numerical solution an invariant imbeding technique is presented which is useful in overcoming these frequently encountered instabilities and the results of some numerical experiments are given cacm february 1967 belman r e kagiwada h h kalaba r e ca670206 jb february 28 1978 3:28 pm
