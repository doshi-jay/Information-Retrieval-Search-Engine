a bounded storage algorithm for copying cyclic structures a new algorithm is presented which copies cyclic list structures using bounded workspace and linear time unlike a previous similar algorithm this one makes no assumptions about the storage allocation system in use and uses only operations likely to be available in a high-level language the distinctive feature of this algorithm is a technique for traversing the structure twice using the same spanning tree in each case first from left to right and then from right to left cacm june 1977 robson j m copying shared subtrees cyclic structures 4.49 5.25 ca770609 jb december 28 1977 12:56 pm
