general time-varying systems error sensitivities program the evaluation by the propagation of variance technique of the sensitivity of time-varying systems to initial condition and parameter errors involves the determination of several system-dependent partial derivative matrices this requirement has led to separate programs for each system under investigation a new program through utilization of the wengert differentiation technique automatically determines the required matrices from specific system equations supplied in subroutine form at execution time eliminating the need for individualized programs and presaging the further development of extremely general computer programs cacm december 1966 wilkins r d ca661203 jb march 2 1978 2:44 pm
