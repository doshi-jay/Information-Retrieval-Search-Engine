a new integration algorithm for ordinary differential equations based on continued fraction approximations a new integration algorithm is found and an implementation is compared with other programmed algorithms the new algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving the initial value problem in ordinary differential equations it is designed to approximate poles of small integer order in the solutions of the differential equations by continued fractions obtained by manipulating the sums of truncated taylor series expansions the new method is compared with gragg-bulirsh-stoer and the taylor series method the taylor series method and the new method are shown to be superior in speed and accuracy while the new method is shown to be most superior when the solution is required near a singularity the new method can finally be seen to pass automatically through singularities where all the other methods which are discussed will have failed cacm september 1974 willers i m ordinary differential equations initial value problem integration taylor series singularities continued fractions program comparison 5.17 ca740902 jb january 17 1978 9:06 am
