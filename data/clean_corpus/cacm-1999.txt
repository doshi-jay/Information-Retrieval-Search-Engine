optimal starting approximations for generating square root for slow or no divide on machine with slow or no division it is preferable to use an iterative scheme for the square root different from the classical heron scheme the problem of optimal initial approximants is considered and some optimal polynomial initial approximations are tabulated cacm september 1970 wilson m w square root newton-raphson iteration optimal approximants 5.13 ca700906 jb february 10 1978 1:33 pm
