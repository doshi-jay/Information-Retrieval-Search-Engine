a model for verification of data security in operating systems program verification applied to kernel architectures forms a promising method for providing uncircumventably secure shared computer systems a precise definition of data security is developed here in terms of a general model for operating systems this model is suitable as a basis for verifying many of those properties of an operating system which are necessary to assure reliable enforcement of security the application of this approach to the ucla secure operating system is also discussed cacm september 1978 popek g farber d operating systems security protection program verification 4.35 5.24 ca780904 dh february 5 1979 2:40 pm
