machine calculation of moments of a probability distribution a method is presented for the calculation on a machine of the moments of a probability distribution necessitating little more than n additions and n references to memory for each moment instead of the minimum of n multiplication 2n additions and 2n references to memory required by the most straightforward method where n is the number of entries in the probability distribution the method is directly applicable when a tabulated distribution exists as when it has been computed by repeated convolution but in this case it conserves both time and accuracy cacm december 1961 lechner j a ca611209 jb march 15 1978 10:15 pm
