optimal his togram matching by monotone gray level transformation this paper investigates the problem of optimal his togram matching using monotone gray level transformation which always assigns all picture points of a given gray level i to another gray level ti such that if i  j then ti  tj the objective is to find a transformed digital picture of a given picture such that the sum of absolute errors between the gray level his togram of the transformed picture and that of a reference picture is minimized this is equivalent to placing k1 linearly ordered objects of different sized one by one into k2 linearly ordered boxes of assorted sizes such that the accumulated error of space under packed or overpacked in the boxes is minimized the placement function is monotonic which ensures a polynomial time solution to this problem a tree search algorithm for optimal his togram matching is presented which has time complexity ok1 x k2 if the monotone property is dropped then the problem becomes np-complete even if it is restricted to k2  2 cacm october 1978 chang s wong y optimal his togram matching gray level transformation packing problem tree searching algorithm picture processing 3.24 5.25 5.42 ca781004 dh january 29 1979 6:08 pm
