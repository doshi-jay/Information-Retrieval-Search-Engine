wengerts numerical method for partial derivatives orbit determination and quasilinearization in a recent article in the communications of the acm r wengert suggested a technique for machine evaluation of the partial derivatives of a function given in analytical form in solving non-linear boundary-value problems using quasilinearization many partial derivatives must be formed analytically and then evaluated numerically wengerts method appears very attractive from the programming viewpoint equations which might not otherwise be undertaken cacm april 1965 bellman r e kagiwada h kalaba r e ca650413 jb march 7 1978 3:39 pm
