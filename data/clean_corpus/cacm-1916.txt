analysis of boolean program models for time-shared paged environments directed graphs or their associated matrices are frequently used to represent the logical structure of sequences of computer instructions such techniques are used and in addition data references are represented in a nondirected model the complete structural specification of a program is represented by a combined model a transformation of the combined model yields a new model in which additional timing information is also contained analysis of these models prior to execution yields information valuable in determining segmentation of instructions and data for a time-shared environment as well as for initial page loading during execution the analysis may be used for look ahead control of page turning cacm april 1969 lowe t c time-sharing paging segmentation executive compiler monitor program model 4.39 6.21 ca690401 jb february 17 1978 4:50 pm
