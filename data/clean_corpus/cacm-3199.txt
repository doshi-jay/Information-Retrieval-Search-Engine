algem  an algebraic manipulator algem is a package of subprograms written in slip fortran iv and map 7094 ii to manipulate algebraic expressions algems basic algebraic operations are additions subtractions multiplications division and exponentiation it is capable of handling any number of single letter variables variable exponents and of finding the highest common factor of two polynomials also included are such functions as substitution differentiation determining coefficients of specified variables solving a linear equation basic i/o routines plus other special purpose and arithmetic routines the major innovation of algem over other manipulators is the assignment of types to all expressions and the use of a standard ordering procedure cacm august 1966 gotlieb c c novak r j ca660813 es march 17 1982 10:10 am
