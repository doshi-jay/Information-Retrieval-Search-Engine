the teachable language comprehender a simulation program and theory of language the teachable language comprehender tlc is a program designed to be capable of being taught to comprehend english text when text which the program has not seen before is input to it it comprehends that text by correctly relating each explicit or implicit assertion of the new text to a large memory this memory is a semantic network representing factual assertions about the world the program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text by this means the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory in this form it can be added into the memory both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memorys prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed tlc presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities but within the system notations for expressing either of these are provided thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind the memory structure and comprehension process of tlc allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically that is once such an assertion or capability is put into the system it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future thus the addition of a single factual assertion or linguistic capability will often provide a large increment in tlcs effective knowledge of the world and in its overall ability to comprehend text the programs strategy is presented as a general theory of language comprehension cacm august,1969 quillian m r natural language processing natural language comprehension teachable computer program psychological simulation human memory simulation computer linguistics linguistic performance theory 3.36 3.42 3.62 3.65 3.74 ca690807 jb february 15 1978 5:46 pm
