execution characteristics of programs in a page-on-demand system data are presented which show the execution characteristics of two types of commonly used programs in a large-scale time-shared computer system a software monitoring facility built into the supervisor was used for data collection during normal system operation these data were analyzed and results of this analysis are presented for a fortran compiler and an interactive line file editor probability distribution functions and other data are given for such things as cpu intervals i/o intervals and the number of such intervals during execution empirical distributions are compared with simple theoretical distributions exponential hyperexponential and geometric other data show paging characteristics of tasks as a function of the number of pages those tasks have in core cacm april 1974 boyse j w program behavior virtual memory paging demand paging software monitor program execution characteristics compiler execution behavior editor execution behavior 4.12 4.19 4.32 4.39 4.9 8.1 ca740403 jb january 18 1978 10:12 am
