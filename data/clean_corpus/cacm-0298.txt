a 48-bit pseudo-random number generator a new 48-bit pseudo-random number generator suitable for several computers was tested statistically for randomness to determine its adequacy for use in monte carlo programs frequency tests distributions of certain low-order moments runs up and down and runs above and below the mean were applied to one-half million generated numbers lying within the interval 0,1 and to three sets of integers obtained from specified bits within the generated numbers these tests substantiated the randomness of all numbers except for the set of integers coming from the least significant bits cacm august 1961 kuehn h g ca610806 jb march 16 1978 10:09 pm
