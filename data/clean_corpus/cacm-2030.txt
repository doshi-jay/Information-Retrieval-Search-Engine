context-sensitive parsing this paper presents a canonical form for context-sensitive derivations and a parsing algorithm which finds each context-sensitive analysis once and only once the amount of memory required by the algorithm is essentially no more than the required to store a single complete derivation in addition a modified version of the basic algorithm is presented which blocks infinite analyses for grammars which contain loops the algorithm is also compared with several previous parsers for context-sensitive grammars and general rewriting systems and the difference between the two types of analyses is discussed the algorithm appears to be complementary to an algorithm by s kuno in several respects including the space-time trade-off and the degree of context dependence involved cacm july 1970 woods w a context-sensitive grammars context-sensitive parsing formal grammars formal language theory parsing parsing algorithms recognition algorithms 3.42 5.22 5.23 ca700707 jb february 10 1978 4:43 pm
