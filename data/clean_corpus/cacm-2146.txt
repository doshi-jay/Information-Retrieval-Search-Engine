optimizing the polyphase sort various dispersion algorithms for the polyphase sorting procedure are examinedhe optimum algorithm based on minimizing the total number of unit strings read is displayed the logic of this algorithm is rather complicated hence several other new dispersion algorithms with more straightforward logic are presented of the simple dispersion algorithms discussed the horizontal is best it does approximately one-fourth to one and one-half percent less reading and writing than most algorithms in use today an additional two and one-fourth to three percent improvement can be achieved by utilizing the modified optimum algorithm this algorithm is relatively straightforward but it requires a fairly close estimate of the total number of unit strings before the dispersion begins cacm november 1971 shell d l sorting polyphase sorting dispersion algorithms optimum dispersion algorithm repetition operator 5.31 ca711103 jb february 2 1978 11:39 am
