a cost oriented algorithm for data set allocation in storage hierarchies data set allocation in todays multilevel storage systems is usually based on qualitative ad hoc decisions while it would be desirable to obtain an optimal solution to this allocation problem it is clear that the number of parameters involved makes it intractable to straight-forward solution in such a situation we must find a set of assumptions which simplify the problem greatly but which still provide a basis for considering all significant cost elements this paper presents such a first quantitative allocation step it considers many of the significant detailed costs of system utilization data storage data staging and data migration although many avenues of further improvement are available the present algorithm seems to be usefully accurate as such it can aid in quantifying the problems of data set allocation storage system configuration and new device designs cacm june 1975 lum v y senko m e wang c p ling h data set allocation hierarchical storage storage system configuration data staging data migration storage allocation analysis 3.5 3.9 6.2 ca750603 jb january 9 1978 1:31 pm
