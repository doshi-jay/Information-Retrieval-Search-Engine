normalization techniques for hand printed numerals family of pattern standardization techniques based on geometrical projection is applied to a file of digitized hand printed numerals obtained from sales clerks the principle involves transforming a quadrilateral specified in terms of the convex hull of each pattern into a square the amount of overlap within each class of characters versus the amount between classes is used to evaluate the degree of normalization achieved with respect to other published methods including size and shear normalization through moments cacm august 1970 nagy g tuong n pattern recognition character recognition normalization projective transformation central projection hand printed characters handwriting linear transformation size normalization mapping pattern preprocessor 3.63 5.14 ca700802 jb february 10 1978 4:03 pm
