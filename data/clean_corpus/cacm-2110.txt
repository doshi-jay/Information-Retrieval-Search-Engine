an efficient context-free parsing algorithm a parsing algorithm which seems to be the most efficient general context-free algorithm known is described it is similar to both knuths lrk algorithm and the familiar top-down algorithm it has a time bound proportional to n^3 where n is the length of the string being parsed in general it has a n^2 bound for unambiguous grammars and it runs in linear time on a large class of grammars which seems to include most practical context-free programming language grammars in an empirical comparison it appears to be superior to the top-down and bottom-up algorithms studied by griffiths and petrick cacm february 1970 earley j syntax analysis parsing context-free grammar compilers computational complexity 4.12 5.22 5.23 ca700205 jb february 14 1978 10:35 am
