the programmers workbench-a machine for software development on almost all software development projects the assumption is made that the program development function will be done on the same machine on which the eventual system will run it is only when this production machine is unavailable or when its programming environment is totally inadequate that alternatives are considered in this paper it is suggested that there are many other situations where it would be advantageous to separate the program development and main tenance function onto a specialized computer which is dedicated to that purpose such a computer is here called a programmers workbench the four basic sections of the paper in troduce the subjectoutline the general concept discuss areas where such an approach may prove beneficial and describe an operational system utilizing this concept cacm october 1977 ivie e l computer configurations computer networks software development software engineering software main tenance unix 3.2 3.5 3.7 3.8 4.0 ca771007 jb december 27 1977 10:37 am
