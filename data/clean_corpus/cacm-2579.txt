register allocation via usage counts this paper introduces the notion of usage counts shows how usage counts can be developed by algorithms that eliminate redundant computations and describes how usage counts can provide the basis for register allocation the paper compares register allocation based on usage counts to other commonly used register allocation techniques and presents evidence which shows that the usage count technique is significantly better than these other techniques cacm november 1974 freiburghouse r a optimization redundant computations common subexpressions register allocation compilers programming languages virtual memory demand paging 4.12 4.2 4.39 ca741105 jb january 16 1978 10:24 am
