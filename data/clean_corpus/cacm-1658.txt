analysis of algorithms for the zero-one programming problem this paper is concerned with a review and examination of several existing algorithms for the zero-one programming problem computational experience is summarized the machine time and storage requirements of several of the algorithms are compared over several test problems of small and intermediate size computer experiments still provide little hope of solving problems with over 100 variables with a reasonable amount of machine time cacm december 1968 gue r l liggett j c cain k c operations research optimization theory integer programming zero-one variables algorithms 5.39 5.41 ca681208 jb february 21 1978 1:31 pm
