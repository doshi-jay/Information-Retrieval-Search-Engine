symbolic derivatives without list processing subroutines or recursion a routine has been developed which computes and prints out the symbolic derivative of an absolutely continuous elementary function of one or several variables no use is made of list-processing languages the chain rule is applied and the result is edited to produce results as elegant and efficient as those obtained by hand computation a subset may be imbeded in a formula translator to introduce a differentiation operator into an algebraic programming language cacm august 1965 smith p j ca650808 jb march 6 1978 8:18 pm
