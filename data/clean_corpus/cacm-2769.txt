a modification of warshalls algorithm for the transitive closure of binary relations an algorithm is given for computing the transitive closure of a binary relation that is represented by a boolean matrix the algorithm is similar to warshalls although it executes faster for sparse matrices on most computers particularly in a paging environment cacm april 1975 warren h s jr warshalls algorithm transitive closure reachability matrix directed graph digraph boolean matrix binary relation 5.30 5.32 ca750408 jb january 9 1978 3:49 pm
