attribute based file organization in a paged memory environment the high cost of page accessing implies a need for more careful data organization in a paged memory than is typical of most inverted file and similar approaches to multi-key retrieval this article analyses that cost and proposes a method called multiple key hashing which attempts to minimize it since this approach is not always preferable to inversion a combined method is described the exact specifications of this combination for a file with given data and traffic characteristics is formulated as a mathematical program the proposed heuristic solution to this program can often improve on a simple inversion technique by a factor of 2 or 3 cacm february,1974 rothnie j b jr lozano t file organization paging retrieval algorithm inverted file multiple key hashing 3.70 3.73 3.74 3.79 ca740201 jb january 18 1978 1:37 pm
