the minimization of spatially-multiplexed character sets the paper describes a technique for compacting character sets in a digital computer while retaining fast access to individual bits it considers the problem of minimizing the storage needed to contain such tables reduction techniques are developed and the problem is shown to reduce to a covering problem cacm june 1974 gimpel j f parsing lexical analysisscanning string processing spatial multiplexing 4.9 ca740603 jb january 17 1978 3:31 pm
