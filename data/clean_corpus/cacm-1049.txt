numerical solution of nonlinear two-point boundary problems by finite difference methods solution of nonlinear two-point boundary-value problems is often an extremely difficult task quite apart from questions of reality and uniqueness there is no established numerical technique for this problem at present shooting techniques are the easiest method of attacking these problems when these fail the more difficult method of finite differences can often be used to obtain a solution this paper gives examples and discusses the finite difference method for non-linear two-point boundary-value problems cacm june 1964 holt j f ca640618 jb march 9 1978 9:07 pm
