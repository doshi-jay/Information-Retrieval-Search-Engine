on computing sets of shortest paths in a graph two algorithms are presented that construct the k shortest paths between every pair of vertices in a directed graph these algorithms generalize the floyd algorithm and the dantzig algorithm for finding the shortest path between every pair of vertices in a directed graph cacm june 1974 minieka e graph network shortest path algorithm 5.32 ca740616 jb january 17 1978 1:55 pm
