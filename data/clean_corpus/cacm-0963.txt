relative effects of central processor and input-output speeds upon throughput on the large computer presented in this paper is a technique for determining the relative effects of the internal speed of the computer and the speed of the input-output units upon the overall speed of the system equations are derived which permit the determination of these effects from hardware usage measurements cacm december 1964 white p ca641208 jb march 9 1978 3:34 pm
