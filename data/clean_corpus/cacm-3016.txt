a comparison of numerical techniques in markov modeling this paper presents several numerical methods which may be used to obtain the stationary probability vectors of markovian models an example of a nearly decomposable system is considered and the results obtained by the different methods examined a post mortem reveals why standard techniques often fail to yield the correct results finally a means of estimating the error inherent in the decomposition of certain models is presented cacm february 1978 stewart w markov models numerical techniques simultaneous iteration near-decomposability 4.6 5.14 8.1 ca780207 jb march 28 1978 3:43 pm
