on arithmetic expressions and trees a description is given of how a tree representing the evaluation of an arithmetic expression can be drawn in such a way that the number of accumulators needed for the computation can be represented in a straightforward manner this representation reduces the choice of the best order of computation to a specific problem under the theory of graphs an algorithm to solve this problem is presented cacm february 1969 redziejowski r r arithmetic expression compiler design graph theory programming storage minimization topological orderingtree 4.12 5.32 ca690204 jb february 20 1978 11:11 am
