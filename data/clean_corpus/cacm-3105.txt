a language extension for expressing constraints on data access controlled sharing of information is needed and desirable for many applications and is supported in operating systems by access control mechanisms this paper shows how to extend programming languages to provide controlled sharing the extension permits expression of access constraints on shared data access constraints can apply both to simple objects and to objects that are components of larger objects such as bank account records in a banks data base the constraints are stated declaratively and can be enforced by static checking similar to type checking the approach can be used to extend any strongly-typed language but is particularly suitable for extending languages that support the notion of abstract data types cacm may 1978 jones a liskovb programming languages access control data types abstract data types type checking capabilities 4.20 4.35 ca780502 dh february 26 1979 3:19 pm
