on the numerical solution of boundary value problems for linear ordinary differential equations a numerical method is presented for the solution of boundary value problems involving linear ordinary differential equations the method described is noniterative and makes use of any one-step numerical integration scheme to reduce the problem from one of boundary values to one of initial values comments are made concerning some numerical results of applying the method to a specific problem in addition an extension of the algorithm described to more general problems is discussed cacm january 1964 day j t collins ii g w ca640108 jb march 10 1978 5:32 am
