machine controls for analysis of variance a major problem in using the analysis of variance as the number of factors increases is the exponential rise in the number of interactions even though the experimenter may not be interested in these interactions it is impossible to ignore them in most experimental designs because of the problem of getting error terms it is natural therefore to look to the computer to handle the bulk of work involved in computing the interactions a program device to get the computer to do this is described cacm august 1964 weldon r j ca640816 jb march 9 1978 6:37 pm
