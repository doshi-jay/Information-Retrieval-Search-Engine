permutation of data blocks in a bubble memory a common internal organization of bubble memories consists of a set of minor loops connected through another major loop the problem of obtaining any give n permutation of the minor loop contents in minimum time is studied in this paper a lower bound to the number of steps required buy a permutation algorithm is derived and the class of optimum algorithms is identified cacm january 1979 bongiovanni g luccio f bubble memory memory loops permutation algorithm data block shift 4.34 5.30 6.34 ca790103 dh april 10 1979 12:04 pm
