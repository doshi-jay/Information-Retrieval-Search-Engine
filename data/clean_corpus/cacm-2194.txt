how to keep the addresses short an algorithm is presented for minimizing the sum of the lengths of the blocks of coding produced by an assembler or compiler when 1 the length of each computer instruction is assumed to be either long or short long if the memory location addressed is more than a predetermined distance from the current location short otherwise and 2 there are blocks of instructions whose beginnings origins are separated by prespecified amounts for example some computers permit either 8-bit addressing interpreted relative to the location counter or full 16-bit addressing of all of memory when assembling or compiling two or more blocks of instructions which have many mutual references in such a computer there is no simple iterative procedure for keeping as many of the addresses short as possible this paper demonstrates that a wide class of problems of this type can be formulated as covering problems solvable by means of elementary arithmetic operations on the column vectors of a ternary matrix cacm may 1971 richards d l addressing assembler covering problem integer programming variable-length addressing 4.11 4.12 4.21 5.41 ca710505 jb february 3 1978 2:40 pm
