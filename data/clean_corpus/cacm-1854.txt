on multiprogramming machine coding and computer organization the author feels that the interrupt feature which is available in most modern computers is a potent source of programming pitfalls and errors and that it therefore may heavily contribute to the unreliability of programs making use of it a programming scheme is presented which avoids the concept of the interrupt and permits the specification of concurrent or pseudoconcurrent activities in a supposedly more perspicuous manner it is intended to serve as a basis for the construction of operating systems which are prime examples of programs with concurrent activities the scheme includes a set of basic instructions for the generation termination and synchronization of parallel processes a set of routines representing these instructions and thereby simulating a hypothetical machine organization has been implemented and test on the ibm system/360 two programs using these instructions written in pl360 are presented cacm september 1969 wirth n multiprogramming parallelism interrupt input-output computer organization file handling pl360 4.21 4.22 4.32 4.41 6.21 ca690901 jb february 15 1978 5:14 pm
