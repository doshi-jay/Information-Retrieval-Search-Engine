a new uniform pseudorandom number generator a new multiplicative congruential pseudorandom number generator is discussed in which the modulus is the largest prime within accumulator capacity and the multiplier is a primitive root of that prime this generator passes the usual statistical tests and in addition the least significant bits appear to be as random as the most significant bits-a property which generators having modulus 2^k do not possess cacm june 1966 hutchinson d w ca660602 jb march 3 1978 9:01 am
