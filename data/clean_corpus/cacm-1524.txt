a stopping criterion for polynomial root finding when searching for the root of a polynomial it is generally difficult to know just when to accept a number as an adequate approximation to the root in this paper an algorithm is presented which allows one to terminate the iteration process on the basis of calculated bounds for the roundoff error which occurs in evaluating the polynomial this stopping criterion has been tested on numerous examples and has been found to serve as a satisfactory means for accepting a complex number as a zero of a real polynomial cacm october 1967 adams d a ca671009 jb february 27 1978 1:56 pm
