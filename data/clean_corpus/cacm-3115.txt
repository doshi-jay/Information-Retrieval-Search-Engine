orderly enumeration of nonsingular binary matrices applied to text encryption nonsingular binary matrices of order n ie nonsingular over the field 0 1 and an initial segment of the natural numbers are placed in one-to-one correspondence each natural number corresponds to two intermediate vectors these vectors are mapped into a nonsingular binary matrix examples of complete enumeration of all 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 nonsingular binary matrices were produced by mapping the intermediate vectors to the matrices the mapping has application to the vernam encipherment method using pseudorandom number sequences a bit string formed form bytes of text of a data encryption key can be used as a representation of a natural number this natural number is transformed to a nonsingular binary matrix key leverage is obtained by using the matrix as aseed in a shift register sequence pseudorandom number generator cacm april 1978 payne w mcmillen k binary matrices combinatorics combinations nonsingular matrices encryption vernam pseudorandom numbers feedback shiftregister sequences random numbers 3.7 5.3 ca780401 dh february 27 1979 11:05 am
