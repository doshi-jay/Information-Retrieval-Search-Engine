an approximate method for generating symmetric random variables a method for generating values of continuous symmetric random variables that is relatively fast requires essentially no computer memory and is easy to use is developed the method which uses a uniform zero-one random number source is based on the inverse function of the lambda distribution of turkey since it approximates many of the continuous theoretical distributions and empirical distributions frequently used in simulations the method should be useful to simulation practitioners cacm november 1972 ramberg j s schmeiser b w simulation monte carlo probability statistics approximations random variables random numbers moments distribution 5.5 8.1 ca721108 jb january 27 1978 1:47 pm
