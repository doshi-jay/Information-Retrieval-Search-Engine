the use of quadratic residue research a quadratic residue search method has previously been suggested to avoid the clustering usually encountered when hash address collisions occur and linear search methods are used the search size because of the property of quadratic residues is limited to one half of the storage table it is shown that for some classes of prime numbers the complement of the set of quadratic residues can easily be determined and hence the entire table of size p where p is that prime number can be searched cacm february 1970 radke c e quadratic residue search method hash addressing address clustering scatter storage file searching file addressing hash coding quadratic search random search storage layout searching 3.7 3.73 3.74 ca700206 jb february 14 1978 10:30 am
