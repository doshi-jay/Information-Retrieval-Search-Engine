an algorithm for planning collision-free paths among polyhedral obstacles this paper describes a collision avoidance algorithm for planning a safe path for a polyhedral object moving among known polyhedral objects the algorithm transforms the obstacles so that they represent the locus of forbidden positions for an arbitrary reference point on the moving object a trajectory of this reference point which avoids all forbidden regions is free of collisions trajectories are found by searching a network which indicates for each vertex in the transformed obstacles which other vertices can be reached safely cacm october 1979 lozano-perez t wesley m path finding collision-free paths polyhedral objects polyhedral obstacles graph searching growing objects 3.15 3.64 3.66 8.1 ca791005 db january 17 1980 10:13 am
