parameters for pseudo runge-kutta methods the object of this note is to present a choice of the free parameters in the third and fourth-order pseudo runge-kutta methods involving two points this choice of parameters causes a bound on the principal part of the truncation error term to be near the minimum for the fourth-order method and at the minimum for the third-order method cacm february 1967 byrne g d ca670207 jb february 28 1978 3:20 pm
