remarks on the practical solution of characteristic value problems this paper is concerned with the practical solution of characteristic value problem for an ordinary differential equation it is at once apparent that sequential computers be they digital or analog solve initial value problems rather than boundary value problems and some mathematical process must be found to compensate for the machines inadequacy compensating for machine imperfection is of course the normal activity of the numerical analyst a number of other papers have applied particular devices to particular problems the purpose of this note is to establish a mathematical framework or model for these practical procedures and thus assist in the use and extension of the ideas in other particular problems cacm june 1959 wouk a ca590606 jb march 22 1978 6:30 pm
