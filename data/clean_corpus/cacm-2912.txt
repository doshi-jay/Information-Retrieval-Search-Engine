concurrent reading and writing the problem of sharing data among asynchronous process is considered it is assumed that only one process at a time can modify the data but concurrent reading and writing is permitted two general theorems are proved and some algorithms are presented to illustrate their use these include a solution to the general problem in which a read is repeated if it might have obtained an incorrect result and two techniques for transmitting messages between processes these solutions do not assume any synchronizing mechanism other than data which can be written by one process and read by other processes cacm november 1977 lamport l asynchronous multiprocessing multiprocess synchronization readers/writers problem shared data 4.32 5.24 ca771104 jb december 27 1977 7:47 am
