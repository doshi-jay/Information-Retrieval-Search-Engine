an optimal real-time algorithm for planar convex hulls an algorithm is described for the construction in real-time of the convex hull of a set of n points in the plane using an appropriate data structure the algorithm constructs the convex hull by successive updates each taking time olog n thereby achieving a total processing time on log n cacm july 1979 preparata f computational geometry convex hull planar set of points real-time algorithms on-line algorithms 4.49 5.25 5.32 ca790702 dh august 22 1979 2:07 pm
