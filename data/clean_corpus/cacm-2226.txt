further evidence for the analysis of algorithms for the zero-one programming problem the purpose of this note is to report computational experience additional to that recently summarized by gue et al with two algorithms for the zero-one linear programming problem an error in gues paper is corrected the utility of one of the algorithms as a suboptimizer is indicated cacm january 1971 proll l g operations research integer programming zero-one variables algorithms 5.39 5.41 ca710108 jb february 8 1978 10:32 am
