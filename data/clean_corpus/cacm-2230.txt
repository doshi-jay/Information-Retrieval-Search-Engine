a language for treating geometric patterns in a two-dimensional space in this paper cadep a problem-oriented language for positioning geometric patterns in a two-dimensional space is presented although the language has been specifically designed for the automatic generation of integrated circuit masks it turns out to be well suited also for such other placement problems as architecture design urban planning logical and block diagram representation the design criteria the structure and the specific features of cadep are illustrated cacm january 1971 bracchi g ferrari d graphic language problem-oriented language two-dimensional patterns graphic display fortran extension layout problems integrated circuit architecture design urban planning 3.23 3.24 3.25 4.22 ca710104 jb february 8 1978 11:17 am
