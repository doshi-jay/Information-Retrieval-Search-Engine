exclusive simulation of activity in digital networks a technique for simulating the detailed logic networks of large and active digital systems is described essential objectives sought are improved ease and economy in model generation economy in execution time and space and a facility for handling simultaneous activities the main results obtained are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioral model description a reduction of manual tasks in converting boolean logic into a structural model the elimination of manual processes in achieving exclusive simulation of activity an event-scheduling technique which does not deteriorate in economy as the event queue grows in length and a simulation procedure which deals effectively with any mixture of serial and simultaneous activities the passage of time is simulated in a precise quantitative fashion and systems to be simulated may be combinations of synchronous and asynchronous logic certain aspects of the techniques described may be used for the simulation of network structures other than digital networks cacm february 1969 ulrich e g simulation logical simulation digital simulation large systems simulation network structures scheduling queuing simultaneous activities parallel events 4.22 4.29 6.9 ca690210 jb february 20 1978 9:58 am
