petri nets and speed independent design petri nets are investigated as one method of modeling speed independent asynchronous circuits a study of circuit realizations of petri nets leads to a demonstration of their usefulness in modeling speed independent operation this usefulness is emphasized by the design of a speed independent processor from modules developed in the investigation of petri net implementation cacm august 1973 misunas d speed independent asynchronous petri net 6.1 6.33 ca730805 jb january 23 1978 10:46 am
