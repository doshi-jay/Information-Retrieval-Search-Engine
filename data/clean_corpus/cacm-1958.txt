improving round-off in runge-kutta computations with gills method a runge-kutta-gill scheme in common use is based on an incomplete adaptation for floating point operations of gills method an improved version reduces round-off error significantly in this note the heart of the scheme is presented in fortran language it is then shown how an improved version of the method can be obtained with the addition of two fortran statements the two version is a significant improvement a numerical example comparing the two is included cacm december 1970 thompson r j runge-kutta methods ordinary differential equations round-off error error analysis 5.11 5.17 ca701205 jb february 9 1978 3:40 pm
