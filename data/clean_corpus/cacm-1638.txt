sorting by replacement selecting in sorting by replacement selecting the expected length of a sequence beginning with the i-th element i1 is proved to be 2f in accordance with a conjecture of e h friend where f is the number of memory cells used the expected length of the j-th sequence is determined to be f times a j-th degree polynomial in e such that the value of this polynomial approaches 2 as j approaches infinity recursive formulas are obtained for both the mean and the standard deviation of the length of the j-th sequence the mathematical proofs of these results are based upon the assumption that n the number of items to be sorted is infinite but it is shown that the error due to the finiteness of n approaches zero rapidly as n increases cacm february 1967 gasner b j ca670204 jb february 28 1978 3:56 pm
