an efficient incremental automatic garbage collector this paper describes a new way of solving the storage reclamation problem for a system such as lisp that allocates storage automatically from a heap and does not require the programmer to give any indication that particular items are no longer useful or accessible a reference count scheme for reclaiming non-self-referential structures and a linearizing compacting copying scheme to reorganize all storage at the users discretion are proposed the algorithms are designed to work well in systems which use multiple levels of storage and large virtual address space they depend on the fact that most cells are referenced exactly once and that reference counts need only be accurate when storage is about to be reclaimed a transaction file stores changes to reference counts and a multiple reference table stores the count for items which are referenced more than once cacm september 1976 deutsch l p bobrow d g storage management garbage collection lisp 4.19 ca760906 jb january 4 1978 8:58 am
