efficient implementation of a variable projection algorithm for nonlinear least squares problems nonlinear least squares frequently arise for which the variables to be solved for can be separated into a linear and a nonlinear part a variable projection algorithm has been developed recently which is designed to take advantage of the structure of a problem whose variables separate in this way this paper gives a slightly more efficient and slightly more general version of this algorithm than has appeared earlier cacm march 1974 krogh f t nonlinear least squares parameter estimation variable projection 5.14 5.15 ca740313 jb january 18 1978 10:49 am
