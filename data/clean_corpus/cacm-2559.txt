the reallocation of hash-coded tables when the space allocation for a hash-coded table is altered the table entries must be rescattered over the new space a technique for accomplishing this rescattering is presented the technique is independent of both the length of the table and the hashing function used and can be utilized in conjunction with a linear reallocation of the table being rescattered moreover it can be used to eliminate previously flagged deletions from any hash-coded table or to change from one hashing method to another the efficiency of the technique is discussed and theoretical statistics are given cacm january 1973 bays c reallocation dynamic storage hash code scatter storage deletions 3.7 3.73 3.74 4.9 ca730102 jb january 24 1978 4:50 pm
