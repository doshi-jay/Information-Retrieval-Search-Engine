mixed solutions for the deadlock problem mixtures of detection avoidance and prevention provide more effective and practical solutions to the deadlock problem than any one of these alone the individual techniques can be tailored for subproblems of resource allocation and still operate together to prevent deadlocks this paper presents a method based on the concept of the hierarchical operating system for constructing appropriate mixtures and suggests appropriate subsystems for the most frequently occurring resource allocation problems cacm july 1973 howard j h jr deadlocks resource allocation operating systems multiprogramming hierarchical systems 4.30 4.32 ca730704 jb january 23 1978 12:46 pm
