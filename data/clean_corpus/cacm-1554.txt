a computer technique for displaying n-dimensional hyperobjects a digital computer and automatic plotter have been used to generate three-dimensional stereoscopic movies of the three-dimensional parallel and perspective projections of four-dimensional hyperobjects rotating in four-dimensional space the observed projections and their motions were a direct extension of three-dimensional experience but no profound feeling or insight into the fourth spatial dimension was obtained the technique can be generalized to n-dimensions and applied to any n-dimensional hyperobject or hypersurface cacm august 1967 noll a m ca670801 jb february 27 1978 4:48 pm
