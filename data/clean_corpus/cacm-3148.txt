high level programming for distributed computing programming for distributed and other loosely coupled systems is a problem of growing interest this paper describes an approach to distributed computing at the level of general purpose programming languages based on primitive notions of module message and transaction key the methodology is shown to be independent of particular languages and machines it appears to be useful for programming a wide range of tasks this is part of an ambitious program of development in advanced programming languages and relations with other aspects of the project are also discussed cacm june 1979 feldman j distributed computing modules messages assertions 4.22 4.32 ca790604 dh august 21 1979 4:31 pm
