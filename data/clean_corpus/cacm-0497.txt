further remarks on line segment curve-fitting using dynamic programming in a recent paper bellman showed how dynamic programming could be used to determine the solution to a problem previously considered by stone the problem comprises the determination given n of the n points of subdivision of a given interval ab and the corresponding line segments that give the best least squares fit to a function gx in the interval bellman confined himself primarily to the analytical derivation suggesting briefly however how the solution of the equation derived for each particular point of subdivision ui could be reduced to a discrete search in this paper the computational procedure is considered more fully and the similarities to some of stones equations are indicated it is further shown that an equation for ui involving no minimization may be found in addition it is shown how bellmans method may be applied to the curve-fitting problem when the additional constraints are added that the ends of the line segments must be on the curve cacm august 1962 gluss b ca620831 jb march 17 1978 9:19 pm
