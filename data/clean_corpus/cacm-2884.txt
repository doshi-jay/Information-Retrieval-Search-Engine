permutation enumeration four new permutation algorithms classical permutation enumeration algorithms encounter special cases requiring additional computation every nth permutation when generating the n permutations on n marks four new algorithms have the attribute that special cases occur every nn-1permutations two of the algorithms produce the next permutation with a single exchange of two marks the other two algorithms infrequently exchange more than two marks but the rules for generating the next permutation are very simple performance tests which have counted execution of assignment statements comparisons arithmetic operations and subscripted array references have shown superiority of the new algorithms compared to boothroyds implementation of m b wells algorithm and ehrlichs implementation of the johnson-trotter algorithm cacm february 1976 ives f m permutations loop-free algorithms 5.30 ca760203 jb january 5 1978 9:33 am
