the synthesis of solids bounded by many faces a technique is presented which allows a class of solid objects to be synthesized and stored using a computer synthesis begins with primitive solids like a cube wedge or cylinder any solid can be moved scaled or rotated solids may also be added together or subtracted two algorithms to perform addition are described for practical designers the technique has the advantage that operations are concise readily composed and are given in terms of easily imagined solidsuite short sequences of operations suffice to build up complex solids bounded by many faces cacm april 1975 braid i c computational geometry computer-aided design graphics machined components polyhedra shape synthesis three-dimensional modeling 3.2 8.2 ca750406 jb january 9 1978 3:59 pm
