cubic splines on uniform meshes a very simple procedure is presented for constructing cubic splines periodic or nonperiodic on uniform meshes arcs of two cubics suffice to construct a basis of cardinal splines an algorithm is given which requires only minimal storage and computation and permits easy trade-off of one against the other cacm april 1970 nilson e n simple spline representation cardinal splines uniform mesh splines 5.13 ca700408 jb february 13 1978 2:51 pm
