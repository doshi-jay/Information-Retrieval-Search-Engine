efficient generation of the binary reflected gray code and its applications algorithms are presented to generate the n-bit binary reflected gray code and codewords of fixed weight in that code both algorithms are efficient in that the time required to generate the next element from the current one is constant applications to the generation of the combinations of n things taken k at a time the compositions of integers and the permutations of a multiset are discussed cacm september 1976 bitner j r ehrlich g reingold e m gray code combinations subsets compositions combinatorial computing 5.39 ca760905 jb january 4 1978 9:14 am
