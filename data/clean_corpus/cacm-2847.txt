sampling from the gamma distribution on a computer this paper describes a method of generating gamma variates that appears to be less costly than wallaces recently suggested method for large shape parameter a the cost of computation is proportional to a whereas wallaces method is proportional to a experimentation by robinson and lewis indicates that for small a the method suggested here also dominates methods recently suggested by dieter and ahrens albeit those methods dominate for large a the method suggested here uses the rejection technique cacm july 1976 fishman g s gamma variates reflection method sampling 5.5 8.1 8.3 ca760706 jb january 4 1978 12:34 pm
