analysis of interleaved memory systems using blockage buffers a model of interleaved memory systems is presented and the analysis of the model by monte carlo simulation is discussed the simulations investigate the performance of various system structures ie schemes for sending instruction and data requests to the memory system performance is measured by determining the distribution of the number of memory modules in operation during a memory cycle an important observation from these investigations is that separately grouping instruction and data requests for memory can substantially increase the average number of memory modules in operation during a memory cycle results of the simulations and an analytical study are displayed for various system structures cacm february 1975 burnett g j coffman e g jr interleaved memory systems modular memory systems memory performance analysis blockage buffer conflict buffer simulation monte carolo simulation 5.5 6.34 ca750201 jb january 12,1978 8:54 am
