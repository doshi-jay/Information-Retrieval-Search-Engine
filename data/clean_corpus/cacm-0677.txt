length of strings for a merge sort detailed statistics are given on the length of maximal sorted strings which result form the first internal sort phase of a merge sort onto tapes it is shown that the strings produced by an alternating method ie one which produces ascending and descending strings alternately tend to be only three-fourths as long as those in a method which produces only ascending strings contrary to statements which have appeared previously in the literature a slight modification of the read-backward polyphase merge algorithm is therefore suggested cacm november 1963 knuth d e ca631115 jb march 13 1978 3:31 pm
