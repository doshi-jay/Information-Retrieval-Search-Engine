reasoning about arrays a variety of concepts laws and notations are presented which facilitate reasoning about arrays the basic concepts include intervals and their partitions functional restriction images pointwise extension of relations ordering single-point variation of functions various equivalence relations for array values and concatenation the effectiveness of these ideas is illustrated by informal descriptions of algorithms for binary search and merging and by a short formal proof cacm may 1979 reynolds j arrays assertions program proving intervals partitions pointwise extension ordering concatenation binary search merging 4.0 4.22 5.21 5.24 ca790504 dh june 5 1979 3:33 pm
