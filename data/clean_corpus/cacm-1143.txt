analysis of decay-type data a comparative study has been made of a variety of numerical techniques for fitting experimental data of the decay type by forms involving the sums of exponentials statistical errors of the fitted parameters are also calculated these methods have been applied to artificially-generated sets of data as well as to the results of experiments with radioactive tracers on both human and animal subjects results show that the values of the fitted parameters are very sensitive to variations in the fitting procedure therefore great care very sensitive to variations in the fitting procedure therefore great care must be exercised in identifying such values with physical constants although the values of functions derived from these fitted parameters which can definitely be associated with physical entities are generally more stable under variations in the fitting techniques error bounds can be so large that no great confidence can be placed even in them it would therefore appear best to select a uniform technique both for running the experiments and for analyzing the data and then to consider as significant only relative results between one subject and the next cacm january 1964 worsley b h ca640112 jb march 10 1978 5:11 am
