some theorems to aid in solving the file allocation problem the file allocation problem-ie the problem of finding the optimal set of network sites at which to locate copies of a file-is known to be in general polynomial complete heuristics and other aids to finding optimal or near-optimal solutions are therefore much needed in this paper we present three theorems which can be applied a priori to indicate that certain sites should or should not be included in an optimal allocation cacm november 1977 grapa e belford g g file allocation computer networks distributed data management 4.33 ca771116 jb december 27 1977 8:45 am
