a comparative analysis of disk scheduling policies five well-known scheduling policies for movable head disks are compared using the performance criteria of expected seek time system orientedand expected waiting time individual i/o request oriented both analytical and simulation results are obtained the variance of waiting time is introduced as another meaningful measure of performance showing possible discrimination against individual requests then the choice of a utility function to measure total performance including system oriented and individual request oriented measures is described such a function allows one to differentiate among the scheduling policies over a wide range of input loading conditions the selection and implementation of a maximum performance two-policy algorithm are discussed cacm march 1972 teorey t j pinkerton t b access time analytical models auxiliary storage direct access storage disk analysis disk scheduling performance criteria peripheral memory devices real-time systems response time rotational delay scheduling policies seek time simulation storage units time-sharing systems waiting time 3.72 4.32 6.34 ca720306jb january 31 1978 2:38 pm
