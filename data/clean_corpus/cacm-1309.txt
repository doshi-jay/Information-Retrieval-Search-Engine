a computer user-oriented system a computer language system has been developed which makes possible fast preparation of management reports regardless of computational complexity or format variety costs are sufficiently low so that individually tailored reports can be prepared for every manager the system requires initial preparation of large data banks containing data in elementary form use of two special languages extract and matran permits selective extraction of any data subset efficient processing through any computational sequence and flexible presentation of results in either tabular or graphical form matrix algebra is used as a fundamental vehicle for accomplishing both manipulation and computation cacm february 1965 montillon g d ca650215 jb march 7 1978 10:51 pm
