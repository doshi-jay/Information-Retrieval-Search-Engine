a comparison of the correlational behavior of random number generators for the ibm 360 hutchinson states that the new prime modulo multiplicative congruential pseudorandom generator attributed to d h lehmer has passed the usual statistical tests for random number generators it is here empirically shown that generators of this type can produce sequences whose autocorrelation functions up to lag 50 exhibit evidence of nonrandomness for many multiplicative constants an alternative generator proposed by tausworthe which uses irreducible polynomials over the field of characteristic two is shown to be free from this defect the applicability of these two generators to the ibm 360 is then discussed since computer word size can affect a generators statistical behavior the older mixed and simple congruential generators although extensively tested on computers having 36 or more bits per word may not be optimum generators for the ibm 360 cacm september 1968 whittlesey j r random numbers pseudorandom number generators autocorrelation function serial correlation digital shift-register generators linear recurrence modulo two irreducible polynomials primitive trinomials modulo two congruential generators prime numbers statistical tests for randomness ibm 360 32-bit versus 36-bit word size 5.5 ca680910 jb february 21 1978 4:44 pm
