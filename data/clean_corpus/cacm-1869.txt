block structures indirect addressing and garbage collection programming languages have included explicit or implicit block structures to provide a naming convenience for the programmer however when indirect addressing is used as in snobol naming constraints may be introduced two modifications to snobol are described resulting in two desirable consequences 1 naming constraints disappear even when there is indirect addressing within function definitions and 2 there is a significant saving in the number of calls to the garbage collector because some garbage is collected at little expense each time a function returns to its calling program these modifications have been implemented as an extension to a snobol dialect cacm july 1969 kain r y block structures indirect addressing garbage collection local names snobol 4.22 ca690711 jb february 15 1978 6:49 pm
