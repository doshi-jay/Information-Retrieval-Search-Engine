operating system performance an overview of the current and future positions with respect to operating system performance is given while a great deal of information and a large number of models for subsystems have been developed gaps still exist in out knowledge because of the severe interactions between the various subsystems of an operating system an overall model of the total system must be developed to be able to analyze and design the performance aspects of an operating system although such total system designs are exceptional today it is projected that they will become increasingly more common and necessary in the near future such a design philosophy will clearly have a severe impact on the way we go about modularizing operating and computer systems cacm july 1972 lynch w c computer system operating system performance evaluation performance measurement measurement techniques modularity layering structured programming paging virtual memory input/output disk storage facility drum storage facility sector queueing 4.30 6.20 ca720709 jb january 30 1978 2:33 pm
