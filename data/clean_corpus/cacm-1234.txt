the structure of yet another algol compiler a high-speed top down method of syntax analysis which completely eliminates back-up of the source string has been implemented in a convenient macro-language a technique of simulation at compile time of the use of a conventional run-time stack enables the generation of code for expressions which minimizes stores fetches and stack-pointer motion at run time while properly trating recursion and side effects of procedures block structure and recursion are handled without need for interpretive methods at run times the context problem in the transmission to recursive procedures of parameters called by name is solved in a manner which permits the handling of the common cases of simple expressions and array identifiers with particular efficiency cacm july 1965 kanner h kosinski p robinson c l ca650701 jb march 6 1978 9:29 pm
