copying cyclic list structures in linear time using bounded workspace a bounded workspace copying algorithm for arbitrary list structures is given this algorithm operates in linear time and does not require tag bits the best previous bounded workspace copying algorithms achieved n^2 time without tag bits and n log n time with one tag the only restriction on the algorithm given here is that the copy must be placed into a contiguous section of memory the method is applicable to fixed or variable size nodes cacm may 1975 fisher d a list processing copying linear time space complexity 4.49 5.25 ca750501 jb january 9 1978 3:22 pm
