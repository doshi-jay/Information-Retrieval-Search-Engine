a method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems an encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key this has two important consequences 1 couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient only he can decipher the message since only he knows the corresponding decryption key 2 a message can be signed using a privately held decryption key anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key signatures cannot be forged and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature this has obvious applications in electronic mail and electronic funds transfer systems a message is encrypted by representing it as a number m raising m to a publicly specified power e and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product n of two large secret prime numbers p and q decryption is similaronly a different secret power d is used where e  d  1 modp-1  q-1 the security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor n cacm february 1978 rivest r shamir a adleman l digital signatures public-key cryptosystems privacy authentication security factorization prime number electronic mail message-passing electronic funds transfer cryptography 2.12 3.15 3.50 3.81 5.25 ca780202 jb march 28 1978 4:40 pm
