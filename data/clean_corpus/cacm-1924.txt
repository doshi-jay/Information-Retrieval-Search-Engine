organizing matrices and matrix operations for paged memory systems matrix representations and operations are examined for the purpose of minimizing the page faulting occurring in a paged memory system it is shown that carefully designed matrix algorithms can lead to enormous savings in the number of page faults occurring when only a small part of the total matrix can be in main memory at one time examination of addition multiplication and inversion algorithms shows that a partitioned matrix representation ie one submatrix or partition per page in most cases induced fewer page faults than a row-by-row representation the number of page-pulls required by these matrix manipulation algorithms is also studied as a function of the number of pages of main memory available to the algorithm cacm march 1969 mckellar a c coffman jr e g matrix algorithms array processing paging algorithms paged memory systems virtual memory systems array storage allocation storage allocation 4.12 4.39 5.14 ca690303 jb february 20 1978 9:35 am
