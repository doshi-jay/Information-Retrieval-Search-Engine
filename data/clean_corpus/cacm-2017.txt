sorting in a paging environment this sorting study was part of an extensive measurement project undertaken on the m44/44x an experimental paging system which was conceived and implemented at ibm research in order to explore the virtual machine concept the study was concerned with the implementation of sorting procedures in the context of the dynamic paging environment characteristic of virtual memory machines descriptions of the experimental sort programs and analysis of the performance measurement results obtained for them are presented the insight gained from the experimental effort is used to arrive at a set of broad guidelines for writing sort programs for a paging environment cacm august 1970 brawn b s gustavson g mankin e s sorting merging virtual machines paging systems dynamic storage allocation measurement of systems program behavior performance evaluation memory management 4.32 4.49 4.9 5.31 ca700804 jb february 10 1978 3:51 pm
