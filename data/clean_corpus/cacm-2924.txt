an interactive computer graphics approach to surface representation an in teractive computer graphics method has been developed for the rapid generation of arbitrary shaped three-dimensional surfaces the method is a synthesis of spline theory and algorithms an in teractive means for man-machine communication and software for static or dynamic graphics display the basic technique employed is a modified lofting method on which sectional curves are represented by uniform b-splines and the surface is in terpolated between sections by cardinal splines among the features of this method are algorithms which enable in teractive modification of the b-spline representation of the sectional curves at all stages of the process the spatial information is graphically displayed to the user complex surfaces can be created by the combination of a number of shapes that have been separately generated and automatically joined the system has been successfully in terfaced to a variety of analytical routines for structural medical and graphical applications cacm october 1977 wu sheng-chuan abel j f greenberg d p computer graphics three-dimensional surface representation splines loftingfinite element input methods 3.20 3.23 3.34 8.1 8.2 ca771002 jb december 27 1977 11:53 am
