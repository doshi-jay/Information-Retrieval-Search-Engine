combining decision rules in a decision table the techniques for minimizing logic circuits are applied to the simplification of decision tables by the combining of decision rules this method is logically equivalent to the quien-mccluskey method for finding prime implicants if some of the decision rules implied in the else rule occur with low frequency then the else rule can be used to further simplify the decision table several objectives merit consideration in optimizing a decision table1 reducing machine execution time 2 reducing preprocessing time 3 reducing required machine memory 4 reducing the number of decision rules this often improves the clarity of the decision table to a human reader it will be shown that objectives 3 and 4 can be furthered with the above methods objective 1 is also attained if overspecified decision rules are not combined objective 2 must be compared against the potential benefits of objectives 1 3 and 4 in deciding whether to use the above methods cacm august 1975 shwayder k the quine-mccluskey method prime implicants minimization maximization logic circuit boolean method coding decision tables flowcharting sorting 3.5 3.74 4.12 5.31 5.6 ca750809 jb january 6 1978 3:53 pm
