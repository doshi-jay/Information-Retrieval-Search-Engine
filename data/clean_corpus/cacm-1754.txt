dynamic storage allocation systems in many recent computer system designs hardware facilities have been provided for easing the problems of storage allocation a method of characterizing dynamic storage allocation systems-according to the functional capabilities provided and the underlying techniques used-is presented the basic purpose of the paper is to provide a useful perspective from which the utility of various hardware facilities may be assessed a brief survey of storage allocation facilities in several representative computer systems is included as an appendix cacm may 1968 randell b kuehner c j segmentation paging multiprogramming storage allocation storage management virtual memories storage fragmentation storage hierarchies addressing mechanisms 4.30 6.20 ca680502 jb february 23 1978 9:49 am
