rapid computation of general interpolation formulas and mechanical quadrature rules let f have n continuous on a closed interval ab and let l be a linear functional the attempt is made to approximate l f with l q where q is a polynomial approximating f algorithms are developed for rapid computation of l q for a wide class of selections of q which includes the lagrangian and hermitian rules as special cases cacm december 1971 gustafson s linear functionals divided differences newtons interpolation formula 5.13 5.16 ca711208 jb february 2 1978 9:49 am
