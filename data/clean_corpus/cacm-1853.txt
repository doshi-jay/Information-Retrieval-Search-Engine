compact list representation definition garbage collection and system implementation compact lists are stored sequentially in memory rather than chained with pointers since this is not always convenient the swym system permits a list to be chained compact or any combination of the two a description is given of that list representation and the operators implemented most are similar to those of lisp 1.5 the system garbage collector attempts to make all lists compact it relocates and rearranges all of list storage using temporary storage this unique list-compacting garbage collection algorithm is presented in detail several classes of the macros used to implement the system are described finally consideration is given to those design factors essential to the success of a plex processing system implementation cacm september 1969 hansen w j data structure data representation list structure list representation list compact list garbage collection relocation storage reclamation macro primitive list operations plex processing plex pointer list processing system lisp free storage 3.49 4.20 4.22 4.49 4.9 ca690902 jb february 15 1978 5:01 pm
