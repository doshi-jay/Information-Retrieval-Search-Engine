coding the lehmer pseudo-random number generator an algorithm and coding technique is presented for quick evaluation of the lehmer pseudo-random number generator modulo 231  1 a prime mersenne number with produces 231  2 numbers on a p-bit greater than 31 computer the computation method is extendible to limited problems in modular arithmetic prime factorization for 261  2 and a primitive root for 261  1 the next largest prime mersenne number are given for possible construction of a pseudo-random number generator of increased cycle length cacm february 1969 payne w h rabung j r bogyo t p pseudo-random number random number modular arithmetic uniform probability density uniform frequency function simulation prime factorization primitive roots ca690205 jb february 20 1978 11:07 am
