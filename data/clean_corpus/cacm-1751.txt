the working set model for program behavior probably the most basic reason behind the absence of a general treatment of resource allocation in modern computer systems is an adequate model for program behavior in this paper a new model the working set model is developed the working set of pages associated with a process defined to be the collection of its most recently used pages provides knowledge vital to the dynamic management of paged memories process and working set are shown to be manifestations of the same ongoing computational activity then processor demand and memory demand are defined and resource allocation is formulated as the problem of balancing demands against available equipment cacm may 1968 denning p j general operating system concepts multiprocessing multiprogramming operating systems program behavior program models resource allocation scheduling storage allocation 4.30 4.32 ca680505 jb february 23 1978 9:33 am
