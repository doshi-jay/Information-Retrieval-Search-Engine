the spectra 70/45 emulator for the rca 301 the rca 301 emulator system is supplied with the spectra 70/45 as a reprogramming aid it allows an rca 301 object program to be run on the spectra 70/45 without necessitating changes in the rca 301 object code execution rates are considerably better than traditional simulation the emulator provides an increase in throughput capacity for the 301 user on the spectra 70/45 the emulator makes use of both hardware micro-program routines and software routines to accomplish its function cacm december 1965 benjamin r i ca651204 jb march 6 1978 4:15 pm
