on a divide-and-correct method for variable precision division described in this paper is a divide-and-correct method for variable precision division in digital computers unlike the earlier methods of stein and pope the present method uses a suitably rounded form of the normalized divisor for getting an estimate of the quotient characters this results in a correction of at most plus or minus one to the estimate to obtain the exact quotient character it is believed that this method will be widely applicable for division operations in variable word-length character-oriented machines cacm march 1965 krishnamurthy e v ca650315jb march 7 1978 4:16 pm
