eliminating monotonous mathematics with formac the formac formula manipulation compiler programming system provides a powerful tool for performing mathematical analysis it is an extension of fortran iv which permits the use of the computer to perform the tedious algebraic computations that arise in many different fields among the areas in which it has been successfully used are differentiation of complicated expressions expansion of truncated power series solution of simultaneous equations with literal coefficients nonlinear maximum likelihood estimation tensor analysis and generation of the coefficients of equations in keplerian motion these types of analysis-which arose in the solution of specific practical problems in physics engineering astronomy statistics and astronautics-are discussed in the paper in addition to its usage for specific problem solutions formac can also be used to automate the analysis phase in certain production programming several such applications are presented cacm october 1966 tobey r g ca661002 jb march 2 1978 4:14 pm
