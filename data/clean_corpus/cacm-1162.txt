an assembly language for reprogramming complete reprogramming of compiler language programs is seldom necessary it is assembly language programs which present the greatest difficulty assembly languages generally provide a one-for-one translation from a symbolic to a numeric version of a program that is from assembly language to machine language the meta-language presented here can be used to specify the mapping of any language which conforms to a canonical list form into an arbitrary stream of bits this bit stream may be treated as a machine language program a character stream or whatever else the user might desire thus this meta-language can be used to map from one assembly language into another or from the assembly language for one machine into the machine language of another cacm december 1965 graham m l ingerman p z ca651207 jb march 6 1978 4:01 pm
