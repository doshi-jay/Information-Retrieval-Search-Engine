a fast algorithm for computing longest common subsequences previously published algorithms for finding the longest common subsequence of two sequences of length n have had a best-case running time of on^2 an algorithm for this problem is presented which has a running time of or + nlog n where r is the total number of ordered pairs of positions at which the two sequences match thus in the worst case the algorithm has a running time of on^2 log n however for those applications where most positions of one sequence match relatively few positions in the other sequence a running time of on log n can be expected cacm may 1977 hunt j w szymanski t g longest common subsequence efficient algorithms 3.73 3.63 5.25 ca770509 jb december 29 1977 1:46 am
