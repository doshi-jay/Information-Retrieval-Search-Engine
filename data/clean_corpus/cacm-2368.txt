an implemented graph algorithm for winning shannon switching games in this tutorial paper a computer program which wins shannon switching games is described since these games are played on graphs the program is a good example of the implementation of graph algorithms the two players in a shannon switching game connect and cut have nonsimilar goals either connect cut or the player moving first is guaranteed the existence of a winning strategy the simple strategy explained in this paper is valid in all three cases in fact the major routines never need to know whether the computer is connect or cut cacm april 1972 chase s m graph algorithms graph processing shannon switching games game playing graph theory positional games demonstration programs game theory spinning trees 3.69 5.32 ca720405 jb january 31 1978 1:34 pm
