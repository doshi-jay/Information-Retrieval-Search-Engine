proof techniques for hierarchically structured programs a method for describing and structuring programs that simplifies proofs of their correctness is presented the method formally represents a program in terms of levels of abstraction each level of which can be described by a self-contained nonprocedural specification the proofs like the programs are structured by levels although only manual proofs are described in the paper the method is also applicable to semi-automatic and automatic proofs preliminary results are encouraging indicating that the method can be applied to large programs such as operating systems cacm april 1977 robinson l levitt k n hierarchical structure program verification structured programming formal specification abstraction and programming methodology 4.0 4.29 4.9 5.24 ca770410 jb december 29 1977 4:53 am
