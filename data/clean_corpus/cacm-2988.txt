memory management and response time this paper presents a computationally tractable methodology for including accurately the effects of finite memory size and workload memory requirements in queueing network models of computer systems empirical analyses and analytic studies based on applying this methodology to an actual multiaccess in teractive system are reported relations between workload variables such as memory requirement distribution and job swap time and performance measures such as response time and memory utilization are graphically displayed a multiphase analytically soluble model is proposed as being broadly applicable to the analysis of in teractive computer systems which use nonpaged memories cacm march 1977 brown r m browne j c chandy k m memory management system performance queueing network models in teractive computer systems 4.32 ca770304 jb december 30 1977 12:51 am
