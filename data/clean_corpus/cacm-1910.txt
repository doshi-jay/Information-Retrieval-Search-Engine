an algorithm for solving a special class of tridiagonal systems of linear equations an algorithm is presented for solving a system of linear equation buk where b is tridiagonal and of a special form it is shown that this algorithm is almost twice as fast as the gaussian elimination method usually suggested for solving such systems in addition explicit formulas for the inverse and determinant of the matrix b are given cacm april 1969 rose d j tridiagonal gaussian elimination central difference 5.14 5.17 ca690407 jb february 17 1978 4:18 pm
