a variation of the goodman-lance method for the solution of two-point boundary value problems a recently published method for the interpolative solution of nonlinear equations is improved and applied to give a significant variation of the goodman-lance method for the solution of two-point boundary value problems the resulting method applies in particular to the numerical solution of optimal control problems in the euler-lagrange formulation quantitative estimates are presented which indicate that the variation is nearly twice as fast on some problems in the latter context cacm september 1970 kimble g w goodman-lance boundary-value problems newtons method nonlinear equations optimal control optimization ordinary differential equations secant method interpolative solution orthogonal matrices 3.21 5.15 5.17 ca700905 jb february 10 1978 1:39 pm
