signature simulation and certain cryptographic codes three cyphers allegedly authored by thomas jefferson beale in 1822 have been the subject of intensive study for over 100 years generations of cryptanalysts have expended untold man-years thus far without success attempting tode code them vast armies of fortune hunters and treasure seekers have devoted herculean labors to digging up the rolling hills of virginia trying to locate the promised bonanza the history of pertinent activities would fill volumes yet serious students of cryptography have always had nagging doubts about the cyphers authenticity it has been alleged that the known solution to cypher number two 115 73 24 818 37 52 49i have deposited in the county of bedford about four miles from bufords in an excavation or vault with the aid of an unsanitized version of the declaration of independence was merely a superb imaginative and grandiose hoax perpetrated ages ago for whatever reasons modern computer technology could obviously perform signature analyses the process of encoding itself so as to yield new clues and deeper insights into their construction for the benefit of the uninitiated the encoding method used in the second cypher employs a specified document whose words are simply numbered consecutively and first letters of these words are sought out at random to match the letters of these words are sought out at random to match the letters of the clear text or message the sequence of numbers corresponding to these matches is then written down as the final code while primitive the process has the advantage of relative security until the source document becomes known at that moment the cypher can be decoded even by second graders the work now completed with the help of our univac 1108 includes numerous analytical studies of the beale cyphers and various types of simulations for example we have turned the entire process of simulated encoding by various schemes over to the machine and analyzed the signatures of these synthetic codes we have also encoded various messages by hand using different texts and a variety of methods to obtain their signatures these simulations provide convincing evidence that the signatures are both process and data dependent they indicate also very strongly that mr beales cyphers are for real and that it is merely a matter of time before someone finds the correct source document and locates the right vault in the common-wealth of virginia cacm january 1971 hammer c thomas jefferson beale codes cryptanalysis cyphers decoding declaration of independence encoding magna carta pseudotext signature simulation 3.42 3.63 3.65 3.71 ca710101 jb february 8 1978 1:15 pm
