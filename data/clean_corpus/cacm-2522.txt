the design implementation and evaluation of a working set dispatcher the behavior of a computer system is largely dependent upon the algorithms employed to allocate the system resources to the processes competing for them recent research in time-sharing paging systems has developed the working set model for program behavior and are source allocation strategy based on this model has been proposed two implementations along these principles have been reported but it seems that in neither case have further results been announced this report discusses the design and implementation of a dispatcher based on the working set principle presents data to permit analysis of its behavior and indicates future directions of research on methods of controlling a computer system cacm april 1973 rodriguez-rosell j dupuy j p working set dispatcher scheduler time-sharing systems resource allocation software evaluation operating systems supervisory systems 4.31 4.32 ca730406 jb january 24 1978 9:36 am
