synchronizing processors with memory-content-generated interrupts implementations of the lock-unlock method of synchronizing processors in a multiprocessor system usually require uninterruptable memory-pause type instructions an interlock scheme called read-interlock which does not require memory-pause instructions has been developed for a dual dec pdp-10 system with real-time requirements the read-interlock method does require a specialread-interlock instruction in the repertoire of the processors and a special read-interlock cycle in the repertoire of the memory modules when a processor examines a lock a memory location with a read-interlock instruction it will be interrupted if the lock was already set examining a lock immediately sets it if it was not already set this event sequence is a read-interlock cycle writing into a lock clears it having the processor interrupted upon encountering a set lock instead of branching is advantageous if the branch would have resulted in an effective interrupt cacm june 1973 hill j c interruptssupervisors monitors debugging parallel processing associative memories microprogramming 4.32 6.29 ca730603 jb january 23 1978 3:29 pm
