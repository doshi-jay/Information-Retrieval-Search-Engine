an interactive display for approximation by linear programming an interactive program with a graphical display has been developed for the approximation of data by means of a linear combination of functions including splines selected by the user the coefficients of the approximation are determined by linear programming so as to minimize the error in either the l1 or l-infinity norm auxiliary conditions such as monotonicity or convexity of the approximation can also be imposed this interactive system is described and several examples of its use are given cacm november 1970 lafata p rosen j b approximation data fitting functional approximation linear programming interactive graphical display spline functions 5.13 5.41 ca701101 jb february 10 1978 9:06 am
