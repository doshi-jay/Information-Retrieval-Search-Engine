pert time calculations without topological ordering a simplified technique is presented for pert time calculations without topological ordering each event is assigned a unique memory location an activity is represented by a link a link is defined as a memory location containing the address of another memory location the time information for an activity is carried with its link for a typical net the majority of activities can be described by one 36-bit cell each the remainder use two 36-bit cells each the links are unidirectional forward during the te calculation expected completion time for an activitybackward during the tl calculation time latest allowable for completion of an activity the calculations progress through the net topologically even though the net is not represented topologically in core cacm march 1965 lass s e ca650312 jb march 7 1978 6:00 pm
