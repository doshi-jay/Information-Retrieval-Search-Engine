interval arithmetic determinant evaluation and its use in testing for a chebyshev system two recent papers one by hansen and one by hansen and r r smith have shown how interval arithmetic i can be used effectively to bound errors in matrix computations in the present paper a method proposed by hasen and r r smith is compared with straightforward use of i in determinant evaluation computational results show the accuracy and running times that can be expected when using i for determinant evaluation an application using i determinants in a program to test a set of functions to see if they form a chebyshev system is then presented cacm february 1969 smith l b interval arithmetic range arithmetic error bounds determinant evaluation chebyshev system mathematical proof by computer 5.11 5.13 5.14 ca690207 jb february 20 1978 10:49 am
