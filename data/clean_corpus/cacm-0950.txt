parallel methods for integrating ordinary differential equations this paper is dedicated to the proposition that in order to take full advantage for real-time computations of highly parallel computers as can be expected to be available in the near future much of numerical analysis will have to be recast in a more parallel form by this is meant that serial algorithms ought to be replaced by algorithm which consist of several subtasks which can be computed without knowledge of the results of the other subtasks as an example a method is proposed for parallelizing the numerical integration of an ordinary differential equation which process by all standard methods is entirely serial cacm december 1964 nievergelt j ca641221 jb march 9 1978 3:09 pm
