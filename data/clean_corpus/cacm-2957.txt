database abstractions aggregation aggregation is in troduced as an abstraction which is important in conceptualizing the real world aggregation transforms a relationship between objects into a higher-level object a new data type called aggregation is developed which under certain criteria of well-definedness specifies aggregation abstractions relational databases defined as collections of aggregates are structured as a hierarchy on n-ary relations to main tain well-definedness update operations on such databases must preserve two invariants well-defined relations are distinct from relations in third normal form it is shown that these notions are complementary and both are important in database design a top-down methodology for database design is described which separates decisions concerning aggregate structure from decisions concerning key identification it is suggested that aggregate types and other types which support real-world abstractions without in troducing implementation detail should be incorporated into programming languages cacm june 1977 smith j m smith d c p data abstraction relational database data type aggregation database design data structure knowledge representation data definition language 3.65 3.69 3.79 4.29 4.33 4.34 ca770606 jb december 29 1977 12:33 am
