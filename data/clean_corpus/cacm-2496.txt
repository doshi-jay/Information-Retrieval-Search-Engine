on the near-optimality of the shortest-latency-time-first drum scheduling discipline for computer systems in which it is practical to determine the instantaneous drum position a popular discipline for determining the sequence in which the records are to be accessed is the so-called shortest-latency-time-first sltf discipline when a collection of varying-length records is to be accessed from specified drum positions it is known that the sltf discipline does not necessarily minimize the drum latency time however we show that the total time to access the entire collection for any sltf schedule is never as much as a drum revolution longer than a minimum latency schedule cacm june 1973 stone h s fuller s h drum scheduling shortest-access-time-first minimal latency scheduling shortest-latency-time-first 4.31 4.41 6.35 ca730604 jb january 23 1978 3:12 pm
