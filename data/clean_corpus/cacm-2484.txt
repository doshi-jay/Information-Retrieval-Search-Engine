a note on information organization and storage since the logical structure of a data base can be represented by a tree or graph it is quite natural for us to view the process of designing a data base as that of constructing a tree or a graph a general method for constructing such a tree or a graph is provided there are three important elements in this general construction method namely a set of binary relations an algorithm for constructing subsets of a set and an algorithm for selecting an element from the given set of objects the use of different relations and algorithms results in different information structures as list tree ring etc thus the problem of information organization and storage is reduced to that of defining relations and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints the results presented may be valuable to designers as useful design concepts and may serve as a basis for developing a formal theory on the subject cacm july 1973 huang j c data base data-base management information retrieval information structure file organization storage allocation tree graph 3.70 3.73 3.74 5.32 ca730702 jb january 23 1978 1:14 pm
