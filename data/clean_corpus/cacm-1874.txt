generating pseudorandom numbers on a twos complement machine such as the ibm 360 the familiar multiplicative congruential generator is examined in the context of the type of twos complement arithmetic used in the ibm 360 series different sequences of residues are considered and relationships established among them it is shown that a sequence of positive and negative residues may be produced more simply and economically than with the conventional approach and yet have twice the period of the latter without loss of desirable statistical properties another easily generated sequence involving absolute values is also shown to have twice the period but with less attractive statistical properties the statistical properties of these sequences are given and related to previously established criteria cacm july 1969 hemmerle w j random number uniform distribution pseudo-random number random number generator multiplicative congruential generator power residue twos complement arithmetic ibm 360 arithmetic 3.15 5.5 6.32 ca690706 jb february 17 1978 9:17 am
