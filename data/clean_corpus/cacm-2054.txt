on the feasibility of voice input to an on-line computer processing system an on-line digital computer processing system is considered in which an ordinary telephone is the complete terminal device input to the computer being provided as a sequence of spoken words and output to the user being audio responses from the machine the feasibility of implementing such a system with a fortran-like algebraic compiler as the object processor is considered details of a specific word recognition program are given this technique depends on three simplifying restrictions namely a small vocabulary set known speakers and a moment of silence between each input word experimental results are presented giving error rates for different experimental conditions as well as the machine resources required to accommodate several users at a time the results show that at this time it is both economically and logically feasible to handle at least 40 users at a time with an ibm 360/65 computer cacm june 1970 elder h a speech recognition word recognition pattern-matching pattern recognition time-sharing remote access voice input speech input telephone input/output acoustic signal spoken-word input talking to computers man-machine interaction 3.63 3.81 4.32 4.41 6.35 ca700601 jb february 13 1978 12:12 pm
