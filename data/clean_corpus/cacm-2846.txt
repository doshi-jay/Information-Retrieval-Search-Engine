compressed tries this paper presents a new data structure called a compressed trie or c-trie to be used in information retrieval systems it has the same underlying m-ary tree structure as a trie where m is a parameter of the trie but whereas the fields of the nodes in a trie have to be large enough to hold a key or at least a pointer the fields in a c-trie are only one bit long in the analysis part of the paper it will be shown that for a collection of n keys the retrieval time measured in terms of bit inspections of one key is of the order logmn and the storage requirement of the order nm+log2 n bits this improvement in storage requirements and retrieval time is achieved at the cost of decreasing the flexibility of the structure and therefore updating costs are increased first the c-trie is analyzed as a data structure and then several methods of its use for relatively static databases are discussed cacm july 1976 maly k data structure database m-ary tree trie retrieval time storage requirement keys 3.70 3.74 3.75 ca760707 jb january 4 1978 12:26 pm
