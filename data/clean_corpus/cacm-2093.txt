a comparison of error improvement estimates for adaptive trapezoid integration various simple choices of error improvement estimates for the trapezoid rule are studied to demonstrate a comparison procedure which is relatively independent of the profusion of adaptive search and stopping strategies comparisons are based on x^r ` the inclusion of the noninteger powers makes this more realistic than the usual polynomial based comparison behavior near the singularity was found to be the dominant factor and a new estimate based on a constant curvature assumption and parametric differences was considered slightly better than the other choices considered cacm march 1970 schweikert d g adaptive integration error improvement estimate trapezoid rule nonpolynomial error criteria 5.16 ca700305 jb february 13 1978 4:47 pm
