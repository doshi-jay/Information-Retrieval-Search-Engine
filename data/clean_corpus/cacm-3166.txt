computing standard deviations accuracy four algorithms for the numerical computation of the standard deviation of unweighted sampled data are analyzed two of the algorithms are well-known in the statistical and computational literature the other two are new algorithms specifically intended for automatic computation our discussion is expository with emphasis on reaching a suitable definition of accuracy each of the four algorithms is analyzed for the conditions under which it will be accurate we conclude that all four algorithms will provide accurate answers for many problems but two of the algorithms one new one old are substantially more accurate on difficult problems than are the other two cacm september 1979 chan t lewis j mean standard deviation least squares updating estimates rounding error analysis condition number 5.5 5.11 5.19 ca790907 db january 16 1980 4:23 pm
