convert a programming language is described which is applicable to problems conveniently described by transformation rules by this is meant that patterns may be prescribed each being associated with a skeleton so that a series of such pairs may be searched until a pattern is found which matches an expression to be transformed the conditions for a match are governed by a code which also allows subexpressions to be identified and eventually substituted into the corresponding skeleton the primitive patterns and primitive skeletons are described as well as the principle which allow their elaboration in to more complicated patterns and skeletons the advantages of the language are that it allows one to apply transformation rules to lists and arrays as easily as strings that both patterns and skeletons may be defined recursively and that as a consequence programs may be stated quite concisely cacm august 1966 guzman a mcintosh h v ca660808 jb march 2 1978 7:32 pm
