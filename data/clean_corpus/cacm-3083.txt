pseudochaining in hash tables this paper presents pseudochaining as a new collision-resolution method pseudochaining is half way between open addressing and chaining it owes its name to the fact that link fields are present in each cell of the hash table which permits chaining of the first overflow items in the table the efficiency of the method is derived and a tradeoff analysis is given cacm july 1978 halatsis c philokyprou g hash code scatter storage open addressing chaining pseudochaining collision resolution searching uniform probing 3.7 3.73 3.74 4.9 ca780705 dh february 7 1979 4:37 pm
