translation equations input limited transduction expressions or translation equations are used to describe the syntax and left-context sensitive semantics for context-free languages a formal procedure is given for deriving from a set of translation equations the specifications for a pushdown translator the translator consists of mealy form finite-state automata interacting by means of a pushdown stack within the framework described string recognition and parsing may be treated as special cases of the translation problem cacm february 1970 vere s automata turing machines regular expression transduction expression context-free languages translation recognizers parsing meta-compilers pushdown transducer syntax directed compilers finite state automata 4.10 4.12 4.20 5.22 ca700203 jb february 14 1978 10:49 am
