determination of the intersection points of two plane curves by means of differential equations a new method is proposed to calculate the intersection points of two plane curves the theory of singular points off a system of two differential equations is used in developing the method the intersection point to be determined is identified with such a singular point and appropriate modifications are applied to the system to ensure that the singular point be stable ie all integrals which start in the neighborhood of the singular point will always approach this point if the integral parameter tends to infinity in addition a method is described for systematically searching for all intersection points in a prescribed rectangular area cacm july 1968 kuiken h k plane curves intersection points intersections plane curves integration differential equations matrix iteration singular points nonlinear differential equations eigenvalues complex roots roots stationary points runge kutta stable singularity unstable singularity 2.0 3.10 3.20 3.50 5.10 ca680708 jb february 22 1978 11:51 am
