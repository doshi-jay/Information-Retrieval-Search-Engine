on compiling algorithms for arithmetic expressions this paper deals with algorithms concerning arithmetic expressions used in a fortran iv compiler for a hitac-5020 computer having n accumulators the algorithms generate an object code which minimizes the frequency of storing and recovering the partial results of the arithmetic expressions in cases where there are several accumulators cacm august 1967 nakata i ca670804 jb february 27 1978 4:35 pm
