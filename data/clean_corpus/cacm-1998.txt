complex matrix inversion versus real a comparison of complex matrix with real matrix inversion is made it is shown that the complex inversion can be up to twice as fast as the real inversion further the rounding error bound for complex inversion is about one-eighth that of real for gaussian elimination using extended inner product accumulation the bound is half of the real system cacm september 1970 ehrlich l w complex matrix inversion matrix inversion inversion rounding errors rounding error bound error bounds complex rounding error bounds 5.14 5.11 5.10 ca700907 jb february 10 1978 10:19 am
