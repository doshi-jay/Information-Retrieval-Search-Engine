computational aspects of multiple covariance analysis on a multifactor structure the computational procedure for the analysis of multiple covariance in statistics is discussed with reference to the analysis of variance a special operator calculus developed by hartly for programming analysis of variance for multifactor experiments is extended to cover the analysis of covariance this extension is accomplished by utilizing the connection between the analysis of covariance and the analysis of variance and by introducing a new operator the results are illustrated by a numerical example for analysis of covariance in which the basic computations are shown to be carried out by an analysis-of-variance program cacm july 1966 peng k c ca660708 jb march 2 1978 9:18 pm
