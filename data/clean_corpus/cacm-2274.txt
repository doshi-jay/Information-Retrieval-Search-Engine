generating english discourse from semantic networks a system is described for generating english sentences from a form of semantic nets in which the nodes are word-sense meanings and the paths are primarily deep case relations the grammar used by the system is in the form of a network that imposes an ordering on a set of syntactic transformations that are expressed as lisp functions the generation algorithm uses the information in the semantic network to select appropriate generation paths through the grammar the system is designed for use as a computational tool that allows a linguist to develop and study methods for generating surface strings from an underlying semantic structure initial finding with regard to form determiners such as voice form tense and mood some rules for embedding sentences and some attention to pronominal substitution are reported the system is programmed in lisp 1.5 and is available from the authors cacm october 1972 simmons r slocum j semantic nets grammars deep case relations semantic generation discourse generation 3.42 3.65 ca721004 jb january 27 1978 3:10 pm
