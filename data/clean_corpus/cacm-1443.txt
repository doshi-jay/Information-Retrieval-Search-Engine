a method for finding the least squares estimate of the intersection point of two helices in space when the helical trajectories of two charged particles moving away from a common point in a magnetic field are reconstructed from measurements on the tracks the reconstructed tracks are perturbed by measurement and other errors and do not in general intersect a method is given for adjusting the reconstructed tracks in a least squares manner so that they do intersect cacm april 1966 royston r j gregory j ca660406 jb march 3 1978 10:42 am
