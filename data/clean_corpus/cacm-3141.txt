an improved algorithm for decentralized extrema-finding in circular configurations of processes this note presents an improvement to lelanns algorithm for finding the largest or smallest of a set of uniquely numbered processes arranged in a circle in which no central controller exists and the number of processes is not known a priori this decentralized algorithm uses a technique of selective message extinction in order to achieve an average number of message passes of order n log n rather than on2 cacm may 1979 chang e roberts r decentralized algorithms distributed systems operating systems 4.32 4.35 5.25 5.32 ca790502 dh june 5 1979 2:35 pm
