full table quadratic searching for scatter storage the quadratic residue search method for hash tables avoids much of the clustering experienced with a linear search method the simple quadratic search only accesses half the table it has been shown that when the length of the table is a prime of the form 4n+3 where n is an integer the whole table may be accessed by two quadratic searches plus a separate access for the original entry point a search method is presented which is computationally simple has all the advantages of the quadratic search and yet accesses all the table in one sweep cacm august 1970 day a c quadratic residue search method hash tables scatter storage dictionary look-up quadratic search searching hashing hash code clustering collisions 3.7 3.73 3.74 ca700803 jb february 10 1978 3:57 pm
