a procedure for inverting large symmetric matrices in the least squares method for simultaneous adjustment of several parameters the coefficients of the normal equations are the elements of a symmetric positive-definite matrix in order to solve the normal equations and evaluate the precision measures of the resulting parameters inversion of this matrix of coefficients is required many available procedures for matrix inversion do not take advantage of the symmetry thus when programmed for a high-speed computer all n^2 elements must be stored and manipulated whereas only n + 1/2 of them are independent in order to allow a computer of given memory capacity to handle a larger matrix the following procedure for inverting a symmetric matrix has been devised cacm august 1962 busing w r levy h s ca620833 jb march 17 1978 9:09 pm
