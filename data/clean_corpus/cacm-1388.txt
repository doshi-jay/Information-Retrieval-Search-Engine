automast automatic mathematical analysis and symbolic translation a procedure for numerically solving systems of ordinary differential equation is shown to also generate symbolic solutions the procedure is based on a finite taylor series expansion that includes an estimate of the error in the final result a computer program is described that reads in a system of such equations and then generates the expansions for all of the dependent variables the expansions are determined symbolically hence any non-numeric parameters in the original equations are carried automatically into the final expansions thus the exact influence of any parameters on the problem solution can be easily displayed cacm august 1966 ball w e berns r i ca660810 jb march 2 1978 7:16 pm
