the editing of picture segmentations using local analysis of graphs a major problem in picture processing is the elimination of the large number of spurious regions that result from an initial segmentation by region growing techniques such regions have been eliminated either on the basis of semantic information or on the basis of size and contrast a scheme is presented which performs eliminations on the basis of local properties of the region adjacency graph the scheme is based on definitions of graph properties which are satisfied when a spurious region is present then editing is equivalent to fast graph operations a number of examples are shown cacm april 1977 tanimoto s l pavlidis t picture processing pattern recognition segmentation region editing 3.63 ca770402 jb december 29 1977 6:22 am
