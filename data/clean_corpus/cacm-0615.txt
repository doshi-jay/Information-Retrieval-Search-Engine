addressing multidimensional arrays a useful method of representing a function of n variables is to consider the function to assume its values at selected points in n-dimensional space although this picture is of value to the analyst the elements of an n-dimensional array must exist in conventional storage as a linear array or vector the means of performing the transformation of a set of indices locating on array element in n-space to the location address of the element in its storage vector is the subject of this paper it is noted that the index address transformation is computationally identical to the conversion of a number from a fixed to a mixed radix number system several ways of implementing the transformation are described cacm april 1962 hellerman h ca620402 jb march 20 1978 2:29 pm
