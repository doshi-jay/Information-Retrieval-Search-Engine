transient-free working-set statistics transient-free average working set size and transient-free missing-page rate for a finite sample of a reference string are defined use of these statistics is appropriate if the contents of the working set at the start of the recorded string are unknown if a certain stationarity condition holds these statistics provide unbiased estimates of expected working-set sizes missing-page probabilities and in terreference distance probabilities two other pairs of estimators are shown to be biased expressions for the transient-free statistics are obtained in terms of in terval statistics several methods of computation are discussed the usefulness of each depending on length of the sample number of distinct references and the amount of main storage available to the computer performing the calculations in particular methods are described for handling long strings containing many distinct page names cacm february 1977 easton m c bennett b t working set estimation program behavior 4.3 4.6 5.5 ca770204 jb december 30 1977 2:40 am
