a correctness proof of a topology information main tenance protocol for a distributed computer network in order for the nodes of a distributed computer network to communicate each node must have information about the networks topology since nodes and links sometimes crash a scheme is needed to update this information one of the major constrain ts on such a topology information scheme is that it may not involve a central controller the topology information protocol that was implemented on the merit computer network is presented and explained this protocol is quite general and could be implemented on any computer network it is based on barans hot potato heuristic routing doctrine a correctness proof of this topology information protocol is also presented cacm july 1977 tajibnapis w d distributed computer network correctness proofs computer networks distributed control network topology routing problem in networks distributed operating system store and forward packet switching store and forward message switching traffic control 3.81 4.32 ca770703 jb december 28 1977 11:59 am
