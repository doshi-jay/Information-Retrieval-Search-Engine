a lisp garbage-collector for virtual-memory computer systems in this paper a garbage-collection algorithm for list-processing systems which operate within very large virtual memories is described the object of the algorithm is more the compaction of active storage than the discovery of free storage because free storage is never really exhausted the decision to garbage collect is not easily made therefore various criteria of this decision are discussed cacm november 1969 fenichel r r yochelson j c garbage-collector virtual memory list-processing storage-allocation 4.19 4.49 ca691104 jb february 15 1978 12:57 pm
