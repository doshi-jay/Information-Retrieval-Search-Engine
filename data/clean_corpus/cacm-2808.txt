the lemniscate constants the lemniscate constants and indeed some of the methods used for actually computing them have played an enormous part in the development of mathematics an account is given here of some of the methods used-most of the derivations can be made by elementary methods this material can be used for teaching purposes and there is much relevant and interesting historical material the acceleration methods developed for the purpose of evaluating these constants are useful in other problems cacm january 1975 todd j lemniscate acceleration elliptic functions euler transformation 1.2 5.0 ca750103 jb january 12 1978 10:51 am
