connections between accuracy and stability properties of linear multistep formulas this paper is concerned with stability and accuracy of families of linear k-step formulas depending on parameters with particular emphasis on the numerical solution of stiff ordinary differential equations an upper bound pk is derived for the order of accuracy of ainf-stable formulas three criteria are given for a0-stability it is shown that 1 for pk k arbitrary ainf-stability implies certain necessary conditions for a0-stability and for strict stability meaning that the extraneous roots of ppsi satisfy psi1 2 for pk2,3,4and 5 ainf-stability for k5 together with another constraint implies strict stability and 3 for certain one-parameter classes of formulas with pk3,4and/or 5 ainf-stability implies a0-stability cacm january 1975 liniger w stiff equations parametrized linear multistep formulas order of accuracy a0-stability ainf-stability strict stability 5.17 ca750111 jb january 12 1978 9:26 am
