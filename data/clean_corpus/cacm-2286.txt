automatic error analysis for determining precision the problem considered is that of evaluating a rational expression to within any desired tolerance on a computer which performs variable-precision floating-point arithmetic operations an automatic error analysis technique is given for determining directly from the results of a trial low-precision interval arithmetic calculation just how much precision and data accuracy are required to achieve a desired final accuracy the technique given generalize easily to the evaluation of many nonrational expressions cacm september 1972 richman p l error analysis interval arithmetic precision control 5.11 ca720904 jb january 27 1978 4:39 pm
