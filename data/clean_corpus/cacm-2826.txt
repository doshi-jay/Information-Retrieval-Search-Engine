interactive skeleton techniques for enhancing motion dynamics in key frame animation a significant increase in the capability for controlling motion dynamics in key frame animation is achieved through skeleton control this technique allows an animator to develop a complex motion sequence by animating a stick figure representation of an image this control sequence is then used to drive an image sequence through the same movement the simplicity of the stick figure image encourages a high level of interaction during the design stage its compatibility with the basic key frame animation technique permits skeleton control to be applied selectively to only those components of a composite image sequence that require enhancement cacm october 1976 burtnyk n wein m interactive graphics computer generated animation key frame animation interactive skeleton control stick figure animation 3.41 3.49 4.9 8.2 ca761005 jb january 3 1978 4:24 pm
