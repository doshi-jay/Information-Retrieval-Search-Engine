optimizing bit-time computer simulation a major component of a bit-time computer simulation program is the boolean compiler the compiler accepts the boolean functions representing the simulated computers digital circuits and generates corresponding sets of machine instructions which are subsequently executed on the host computer techniques are discussed for increasing the sophistication of the boolean compiler so as to optimize bit-time computer simulation the techniques are applicable to any general-purpose computer cacm november 1963 katzj h ca631114 jb march 13 1978 3:34 pm
