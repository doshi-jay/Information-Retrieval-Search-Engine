experimental investigations of the utility of detailed flowcharts in programming this paper describes previous research on flowcharts and a series of controlled experiments to test the utility of detailed flowcharts as an aid to program composition comprehension debugging and modification no statistically significant difference between flowchart and nonflowchart groups has been shown thereby calling into question the utility of detailed flowcharting a program of further research is suggested cacm june 1977 shneiderman b mayer r mckay d heller p flowcharts program composition program comprehension debugging modification experimental testing human factors 1.5 4.0 ca770602 jb december 29 1977 1:33 am
