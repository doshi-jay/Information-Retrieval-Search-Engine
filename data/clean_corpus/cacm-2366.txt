complex gamma function with error control an algorithm to compute the gamma function and log gamma function of a complex variable is presented the standard algorithm is modified in several respects to insure the continuity of the function value and to reduce accumulation of round-off errors in addition to computation of function values this algorithm includes an object-time estimation of round-off errors experimental data with regard to the effectiveness of this error control are presented a fortran program for the algorithm appears in the algorithms section of this issue cacm april 1972 kuki h complex gamma function gamma function complex log gamma function loggamma function round-off error control inherent error control run-time error estimates error estimates 5.11 5.12 ca720407 jb january 31 1978 12:59 pm
