an exponential method of numerical integration of ordinary differential equations a formula for numerical integration is prepared which involves an exponential term this formula is compared to two standard integration methods and it is shown that for a large class of differential equations the exponential formula has superior stability properties for large step sizes thus this formula may be used with a large step size to decrease the total computing time for a solution significantly particularly in those engineering problems where high accuracy is not needed cacm august 1963 pope d a ca630843 jb march 13 1978 7:52 pm
