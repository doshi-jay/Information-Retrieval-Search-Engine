a nonrecursive method of syntax specification the use of the kleene regular expression notation for describing algebraic language syntax in particular of algol is described in this paper a fortran ii computer program for carrying out the elimination algorithm of gornsimilar to gaussian elimination for linear systems of algebraic equations is described this was applied to numerous smaller languages including some sublanguage of algol a hand calculation result of the application of the algorithm to all of algol is given thus expressing the revised algol 1960 syntax in completely nonrecursive terms as far as its context-free portion is concerned this description in many ways is far more intuitively understood than the previous recursive description it is suggested the paper also includes results of the machine program which does not include a simplification algorithm cacm april 1966 carr iii j w weiland j ca660402 jb march 3 1978 11:02 am
