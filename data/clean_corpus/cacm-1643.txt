an improvement to iterative methods of polynomial factorization methods of polynomial factorization which find the zeros one at a time require the division of the polynomial by the accepted factor it is shown how the accuracy of this division may be increased by dividing in order of both ascending and descending powers of the variable and choosing a crossover point which minimizes a very simply calculated error criterion cacm january 1967 bingham j a c ca670112 jb february 28 1978 4:20 pm
