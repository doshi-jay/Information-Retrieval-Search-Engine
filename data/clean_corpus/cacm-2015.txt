a technique for generating almost optimal floyd-evans productions for precedence grammars a technique is developed for generating almost optimal floyd-evans productions given a precedence grammar a graph formulation is used for the problem of merging productions the productions generated correspond to the minimum cost inverse-arborescence of that graph the validity of the technique is demonstrated for weak precedence grammars defined here but the productions mechanically generated for any precedence grammar can often be modified in such a way that correct almost optimal parsers are obtained cacm august 1970 ichbiah j d morse s p translator writing systems syntactic analysis floyd-evans productions precedence grammars translator optimization merger algorithm minimum cost inverse-arborescence graph theory 4.12 5.23 5.32 ca700806 jb february 10 19783:38 pm
