degree of multiprogramming in page-on-demand systems a simple stochastic model is described which offers a base for understanding the relationship between the number of programs permitted to share memory the degree of multiprogramming drum traffic rates and central processing unit utilization in page-on-demand multiprogrammed time-shared computer systems the model preserves as a key feature the property of page-demand statistics which implies a burst of page demands at the beginning of any job or quantum execution the model a markov chain is analyzed numerically and the results are presented graphically for a wide range of key environment-descriptive parameters implications of the results to time-shared system design and programming are discussed and a calculation of the optimal degree of multiprogramming for a wide range of parameters is presented graphically cacm june 1969 wallace v l mason d l page-on-demand demand paging time-sharing multiprogramming markovian computer models scheduling strategies operating systems memory management 2.44 4.32 4.39 6.20 6.21 ca690601 jb february 17 1978 1:43 pm
