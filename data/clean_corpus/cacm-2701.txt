a fast and usually linear algorithm for global flow analysis abstract only-complete paper jacm 23,1 january 1976 a new algorithm for global flow analysis on reducible graphs is presented the algorithm is shown to treat a very general class of function spaces for a graph of e edges the algorithm has a worst case time bound of oe log e function operations it is also shown that in programming terms the number of operations is proportional to e plus the number of exits from program loops consequently a restriction to one-entry one-exit control structures linearity the algorithm can be extended to yet larger classes of function spaces and graphs by relaxing the time bound examples are given of code improvement problems which can be solved using the algorithm cacm december 1975 graham s l wegman m global flow analysis data flow code optimization common subexpression elimination live-dead analysis information propagation flow graph reducibility go-to-less programming depth-first search path compression 4.12 5.24 5.25 5.32 ca751206 jb january 5 1978 4:08 pm
