variable-precision exponentiation a previous paper presented an efficient algorithm called the recomputation algorithm for evaluating a rational expression to within any desired tolerance on a computer which performs variable-precision arithmetic operations the recomputation algorithm can be applied to expressions involving any variable-precision operations having o10^-p + sumei error bounds where p denotes the operations precision and ei denotes the error in the operations ith argument this paper presents an efficient variable-precision exponential operation with an error bound of the above order other operations such as log sin and cos which have simple series expansions can be handled similarly cacm january 1973 richman p l variable-precision exponential function error analysis interval arithmetic 5.11 ca730106 jb january 24 1978 4:32 pm
