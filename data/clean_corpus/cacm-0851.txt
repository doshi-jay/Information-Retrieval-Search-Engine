design and characteristics of a variable-length record sort using new fixed-length record sorting techniques this paper describes the application of several new techniques for sorting fixed-length records to the problems of variable-length record sorting the techniques have been implemented on a sylvania 9400 computer system with 32,000 fixed-length words of memory specifically the techniques sequence variable-length records of unrestricted size produce long initial strings of data merge strings of data at the power of t-1 where t is the number of work tapes in a system and do not restrict the volume of input data cacm may,1963 goetz m a ca630516 jb march 14 1978 10:57 am
