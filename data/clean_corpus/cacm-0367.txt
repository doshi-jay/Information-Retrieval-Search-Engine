topological ordering of a list of randomly-numbered elements of a network a network of directed line segments free of circular elements is assumed the lines are identified by their terminal nodes and the nodes are assumed to be numbered by a non-topological system given a list of these lines in numeric order a simple technique can be used to create at high speed a list in topological order cacm april 1961 lasser d j ca610401 jb march 17 1978 12:17 am
