performance evaluation of highly concurrent computers by deterministic simulation simulation is presented as a practical technique for performance evaluation of alternative configurations of highly concurrent computers a technique is described for constructing a detailed deterministic simulation model of a system in the model a control stream replaces the instruction and data streams of the real system simulation of the system model yields the timing and resource usage statistics needed for performance evaluation without the necessity of emulating the system as a case study the implementation of a simulator of a model of the cpu-memory subsystem of the ibm 360/91 is described the results of evaluating some alternative system designs are discussed the experiments reveal that for the case study the major bottlenecks in the system are the memory unit and the fixed point unit further it appears that many of the sophisticated pipelining and buffering technique simplemented in the architecture of the ibm 360/91 are of little value when high-speed cache memory is used as in the ibm 360/195 cacm november 1978 kumar b davidson e performance evaluation deterministic simulation control stream concurrent computers 6.20 8.1 ca781103 dh january 26 1979 11:26 am
