multiprogramming under a page on demand strategy a model of multiprogramming for a particular computer system using a page on demand strategy is developed analysis of this model is used to predict performance measured by the average usage of the cpu when user programs are typical of those arising from an interactive time sharing environment the effect of several hardware modifications is also analyzed a parameter readily calculated from the hardware characteristics and the program statistics is proposed for gauging the effect of multiprogramming cacm october 1967 smith j l ca671007 jb february 27 1978 2:07 pm
