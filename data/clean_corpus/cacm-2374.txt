a study of storage partitioning using a mathematical model of locality both fixed and dynamic storage partitioning procedures are examined for use in multiprogramming systems the storage requirement of programs is modeled as a stationary gaussian process experiments justifying this model are described by means of this model dynamic storage partitioning is shown to provide substantial increases in storage utilization and operating efficiency over fixed partitioning cacm march 1972 coffman jr e g ryan jr t a storage partitioning memory management dynamic storage allocation space sharing multiprogrammed storage working-sets program behavior models mathematical modeling 4.32 4.39 ca720307 jb january 31 1978 2:29 pm
