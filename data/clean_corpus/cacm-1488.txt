programming decision tables in fortran cobol or algol a simple broad-based approach for programming decision tables in fortran or cobol is developed and presented with inputs in standard form as defined in the paper the programming of any decision table can be done with one or two fortran statements or with two cobol statements if the compute verb is available in the cobol processor it is shown that the method is applicable even when there are more than two mutually exclusive states of one two or more table conditions it is further shown that multi-state conditions in decision tables can often simplify the programming the method outlined has the further advantage that all possible combinations of conditions are considered it is shown that the suggested procedure is easily implemented in algol cacm january 1966 veinott c g ca660107 jb march 3 1978 4:08 pm
