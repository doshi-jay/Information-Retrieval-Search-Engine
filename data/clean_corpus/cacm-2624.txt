formal requirements for virtualizable third generation architectures virtual machine systems have been implemented on a limited number of third generation computer systems eg cp-67 on the ibm 360/67 from previous empirical studies it is known that certain third generation computer systems eg the dec pdp-10 cannot support a virtual machine system in this paper model of a third-generation-like computer system is developed formal techniques are used to derive precise sufficient conditions to test whether such an architecture can support virtual machines cacm july 1974 popek g j goldberg r p operating system third generation architecture sensitive instruction formal requirements abstract model proof virtual machine virtual memory hypervisor virtual machine monitor 4.32 4.35 5.21 5.22 ca740707 jb january 17 1978 11:19 am
