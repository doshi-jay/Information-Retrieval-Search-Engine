reduction of a band-symmetric generalized eigenvalue problem an algorithm is described for reducing the generalized eigenvalue problem ax  lambda bx to an ordinary problem in case a and b are symmetric band matrices with b positive definite if n is the order of the matrix and m the bandwidth the matrices a and b are partitioned into m-by-m blocks and the algorithm is described in terms of these blocks the algorithm reduces the generalized problem to an ordinary eigenvalue problem for a symmetric band matrix c whose bandwidth is the same as a and b the algorithm is similar to those of rutishauser and schwartz for the reduction of symmetric matrices to band form the calculation c requires order mn^2 operation the round-off error in the calculation of c is of the same order as the sum of the errors at each of the n/m steps of the algorithm the latter errors being largely determined by the condition of b with respect to inversion cacm january 1973 crawford c r generalized eigenvalues symmetric band matrices 5.14 ca730107 jb january 24 1978 4:26 pm
