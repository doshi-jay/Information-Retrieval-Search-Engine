the development of the mu5 computer system following a brief outline of the background of the mu5 project the aims and ideas for mu5 are discussed a description is then given of the instruction set which includes a number of features conducive to the production of efficient compiled code from high-level language source programs the design of the processor is then traced from the initial ideas for an associatively addressed name store to the final multistage pipeline structure involving a prediction mechanism for instruction prefetching and a function queue for array element accessing an overall view of the complete mu5 complex is presented together with a brief indication of its performance cacm january 1978 ibbett r capon p architecture naming virtual storage instruction set descriptor pipeline instruction buffering associative storage function queue computer complex 4.10 4.12 6.21 6.33 ca780103 jb march 28 1978 5:44 pm
