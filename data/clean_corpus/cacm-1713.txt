on overcoming high-priority paralysis in multiprogramming systems a case his tory high-priority paralysis is the degradation that can occur in multiprogramming systems when scheduling is based primarily on preassigned priorities it can be alleviated by modifying the scheduling algorithm to maximize the number of programs active at one time the case his tory given in this paper indicates two general methods by which simultaneity can be increased possible refinements in the scheduling algorithm for future improvements are considered briefly cacm august 1968 stevens d f multiprogram scheduling dynamic priority assignment scheduling 4.30 4.32 4.39 ca680801 jb february 22 1978 11:19 am
