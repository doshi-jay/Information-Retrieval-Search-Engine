efficient algorithms for graph manipulation h algorithm a447 efficient algorithms are presented for partitioning a graph into connected components biconnected components and simple paths the algorithm for partitioning of a graph into simple paths is iterative and each iteration produces a new path between two vertices already on paths the start vertex can be specified dynamically if v is the number of vertices and e is the number of edges each algorithm requires time and space proportional to max ve when executed on a random access computer cacm june 1973 hopcroft j tarjan r graphsanalysis of algorithms graph manipulation 5.32 ca730610 jb january 23 1978 1:55 pm
