code structures for protection and manipulation of variable-length items when items are made up of a variable number of characters each containing the same number of bits certain control information partition symbols is inserted to mark their separations since errors in identification of these control characters can lead to serious trouble methods of protecting these symbols are indicated a 6-bit code assignment of alphanumeric characters for fixed word-length computers is given and its suitability for error detection and variable-length item manipulation is shown also indicated is its flexibility during certain arithmetic operations cacm january 1965 ramamoorthy c v ca650106 jb march 8 1978 2:48 pm
