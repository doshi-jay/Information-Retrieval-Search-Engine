amesplot-a higher level data plotting software system amesplot is an extensible software system designed to make the display of data as simple painless and neat as possible the system described is hardware-independent and has been implemented on a variety of installations of different manufacturers having diverse configurations the elements common to all types of data plots are outlined and the way in which these elements may be combined into a system based on simple modules is demonstrated these modules are specified independently and are independent of the axis systems or other attributes of the plot this enables plots of any complexity to be constructed by adding or replacing modules the basic syntax of amesplot is outlined and a brief description is given of its current utility software consisting of macros to produce self-scaled plots formal tablets of text-interspersed with subplots map coastlines and 3-d plots the system was formulate d in a way such that the user could supply the minimum of information and it should be fully integrable with users program written in most conventional higher languages the functions of positioning locating and scaling in the layout of multiple subplots of axes labels and all other elements of the plot are handled automatically by the software system unless the user specifies otherwise the structuring of plots from multiple independent self-contained subplots is described transformation projection scaling rotation or shifting of entire plots or subplots by the action of one or more simple modules is possible the user may interact freely with amesplot at three levels enabling him to construct his own data markers alphabetic characters and transformations and to produce a variety of artistic and other effects cacm september 1970 hirschsoln i computer graphics data potting data display syntax hardware independent software display device independent software plot elements self-scaled plots user interaction tablet organization map display projection 4.13 4.29 4.49 4.9 ca700903 jb february 10 1978 2:08 pm
