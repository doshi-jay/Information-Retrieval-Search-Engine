reducing the retrieval time of scatter storage techniques a new method for entering and retrieving information in a hash table is described the method is intended to be efficient if most entries are looked up several times the expected number of probes to look up an entry predicted theoretically and verified by monte carlo experiments is considerably less than for other comparable methods if the table is nearly full an example of a possible fortran implementation is given cacm february 1973 brent r p address calculation content addressing file searching hash addressing hash code linear probing linear quotient method scatter storage searching symbol table 3.7 3.73 3.74 4.1 4.9 ca730205 jb january 24 1978 2:12 pm
