analyses of deterministic parsing algorithms this paper describes an approach for determining the minimum maximum and average times to clean sentences acceptable by a deterministic parser these quantities are presented in the form of symbolic formulas called time-formulas the variables in these formulas represent not only the length of the input string but also the time to perform elementary operations such as pushing popping subscripting iterating etc by binding to the variables actual numerical values corresponding to a given compiler-machine configuration one can determine the execution time for that configuration time-formulas are derived by examining the grammar rules and the program representing the algorithm one wishes to analyze the approach is described by using a specific grammar that defines simple arithmetic expressions two deterministic parsers are analyzed a top-down recursive descent ll1 parser and a bottom-up slr1 parser the paper provides estimates for the relative efficiencies of the two parsers the estimates applicable to a specific machine the pdp-10 are presented and substantiated buy benchmarks finally the paper illustrates the proposed approach by applying it to the analyses of parsers for a simple programming language cacm june 1978 cohen j roth m syntactic analysis analysis of algorithmstop-down and bottom-up parsing relative efficiencies 4.12 5.23 5.24 5.25 5.7 ca780603 dh february 26 1979 12:32 pm
