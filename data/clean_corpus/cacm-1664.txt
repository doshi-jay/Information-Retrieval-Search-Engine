an algorithm for deriving the equations of mathematical physics by symbolic manipulation a method is described whereby a digital computer can be used to derive the equations of mathematical physics in any curvilinear coordinate system requested by the user the effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated by using it to derive the navier-stokes equations of fluid motion and the continuity equation to derive these equations by this method the user need know only the coordinate transformation equations relating the curvilinear coordinates of interest to an orthogonal cartesian triad when this program is used and the coordinate transformation equations are supplied as input the computer will derive the navier-stokes equations and the continuity equation the equations obtained will be relative to the curvilinear coordinate system specified by the transformation equations used as input in this paper the emphasis is on theoretical considerations and methodology rather than on programming details results are presented for cylindrical polar and spherical polar coordinate systems cacm december 1968 howard j c tashjian h formac navier-strokes equations continuity equation tensor tensor equation curvilinear coordinate systems fortran symbolic manipulation 3.21 3.25 3.29 4.12 4.29 ca681202 jb february 21 1978 2:02 pm
