a nonrecursive list moving algorithm an efficient nonrecursive algorithm is given for moving any lisp-type list in particular the algorithm requires no storage other than the new nodes into which the list is to be moved and no additional bits per node for marking the algorithm runs in time proportional to the number of nodes in the list the original list structure is destroyed as it is moved cacm may 1973 reingold e m list moving list copying list traversal garbage collection lisp 4.19 4.49 ca730507 jb january 23 1978 4:45 pm
