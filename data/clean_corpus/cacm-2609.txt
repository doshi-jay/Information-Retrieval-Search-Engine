interpolation with rounded ramp functions a new interpolation function is introduced it has infinitely many continuous derivatives and is a composition of ramp functions with smoothed bends called rounded ramp functions how the interpolation function can be extended to more than one variable is shown an efficient fortran program is given by which the interpolation function can be obtained for a given point set cacm august 1974 lagerlof r o e interpolation approximation smooth interpolation multi variable interpolation interpolation function approximation function spline-like function 5.13 ca740815 jb january 17 1978 9:18 am
