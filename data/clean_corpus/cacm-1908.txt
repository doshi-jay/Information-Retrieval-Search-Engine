time-sharing and batch-processing an experimental comparison of their values in a problem  solving situation an experimental comparison of problem-solving using time-sharing and batch-processing computer systems conducted at mit is described in this paper this study is the first known attempt to evaluate two such systems for what may well be the predominant user population within the next decade-the professionals who as nonprogrammers are using the computer as an aid in decision-making and problem-solving rather than as a programming end in itself statistically and logically significant results indicate equal cost for usage of the two computer systems however a much higher level of performance is attained by time-sharing users there are indications that significantly lower costs would have resulted if the time-sharing users had stopped work when they reached a performance level equal to that of the batch users the users speed of problem-solving and their attitudes made time-sharing the more favorable system cacm may 1969 gold m m time-sharing vs batch-processing user performance man/machine communications cost effectiveness on-line vs off-line performance decision-making performance user/programmer behavior programming experimental empirical studies problem-solving research in man/machine communications man/machine symbiosis 2.11 2.40 3.36 3.51 3.80 ca690501 jb february 17 1978 4:10 pm
