a formac program for the solution of linear boundary and initial value problems a computer program is described which has been developed for obtaining approximate solutions to linear initial and boundary-value problems involving differential equations for each problem input to the program includes 1 the equations in symbolic form to be satisfied  the differential equations equations describing auxiliary conditions such as boundary conditions etc 2 a numerical description of the regions in which each of the equations are to be satisfied 3 sets of functions in symbolic form to be used in linear combinations to approximate the solution functions give the above input the program generates an approximation to the solutions of the specified problemm in terms of the specified functions which is optimum in the least-squares sense cacm august 1966 cuthill e ca660814 es march 17 1982 10:10 am
