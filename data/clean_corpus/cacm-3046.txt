computer generation of gamma random variables  ii a rejection method is proposed for generating gamma variates with nonintegral shape parameter a a  1 this method is similar to other methods given by fishman wallace and tadikamalla and is faster than these methods for a 2 the core storage requirements and the programming effort for the proposed method are similar to those of wallaces or tadikamallas methods the computational times for the proposed method remain fairly constant for medium and large values of a and are superior to times obtained by ahrens and dieters method for all values of a the proposed method is simpler than ahrens and dieters method cacm november 1978 tadikamalla p gamma variables rejection method computer methods 5.5 8.1 ca781105 dh january 26 1979 11:02 am
