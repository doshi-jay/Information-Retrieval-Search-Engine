protection in operating systems a model of protection mechanisms in computing systems is presented and its appropriateness is argued the safety problem for protection systems under this model is to determine in a given situation whether a subject can acquire a particular right to an object in restricted cases it can be shown that this problem is decidable ie there is an algorithm to determine whether a system in a particular configuration is safe in general and under surprisingly weak assumptions it cannot be decided if a situation is safe various implications of this fact are discussed cacm august 1976 harrison m a ruzzo w l ullman j d protection protection system operating system decidability turing machine 4.30 4.31 5.24 ca760804 jb january 4 1978 10:12 am
