minimizing wasted space in partitioned segmentation a paged virtual memory system using a finite number of page sizes is considered two algorithms for assigning pages to segments are discussed both of these algorithm are simple to implement the problem of choosing the page sizes to minimize the expected value of total wasted space in internal fragmentation and in a page table per segment is then solved for a probability density function of segment size which may be expressed as a convex combination of erlang densities cacm june 1973 gelenbe e dynamic storage allocation virtual memory paging multiple page sizes fragmentation segmentation 4.0 4.3 4.32 6.34 8.3 ca730602 jb january 23 1978 3:38 pm
