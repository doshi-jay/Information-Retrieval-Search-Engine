resource management for a medium scale time-sharing operating system task scheduling and resource balancing for a medium size virtual memory paging machine are discussed in relation to a combined batch processing and time-sharing environment a synopsis is given of the task scheduling and paging algorithms that were implemented and the results of comparative simulation are given by tracing the development of the algorithms through six predecessor versions throughout the discussion particular emphasis is placed on balancing the system performance relative to the characteristics of all the system resources simulation results relative to alternate hardware characteristics and the effects of program mix and loading variations are also presented cacm may 1968 oppenheimer g weizer n time-sharing operating systems resource management task scheduling paging system simulation memory management virtual memories 4.30 4.31 4.32 ca680504 jb february 23 1978 9:39 am
