a method for overlapping and erasure of lists an important property of the newell-shaw-simon scheme for computer storage of lists is that data having multiple occurrences need not be stored at more than one place in the computer that is lists may be overlapped unfortunately overlapping poses a problem for subsequent erasure given a list that is no longer needed it is desired to erase just those parts that do not overlap other lists in lisp mccarthy employs an elegant but inefficient solution to the problem the present paper describes a general method which enables efficient erasure the method employs interspersed reference counts to describe the extent of the overlapping cacm december 1960 collins g e ca601210 jb march 20 1978 6:33 pm
