a comment on index register allocation a technique is presented to reduce the enumeration required by a known procedure for optimal index register allocation in straight-line programs this technique is based on the construction of a link diagram which shows at any step the future occurrences of indexes which must be loaded into index registers this diagram determines in advance the required register configuration at certain steps of the program so that the program is subdivided into separate portions to which the allocation procedure may be applied independently cacm september 1967 luccio f ca670909 jb february 27 1978 3:06 pm
