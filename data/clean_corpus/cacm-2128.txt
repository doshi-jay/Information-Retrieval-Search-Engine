a processor allocation method for time-sharing a scheduling algorithm is proposed which is intended to minimize changes of tasks on processors and thereby reduce over-head the algorithm also has application to more general resource allocation problems it is implemented by means of a method for efficiently handling dynamically changing segmented lists cacm january 1970 mullery a p driscoll g c time sharing resource allocation scheduling algorithms monitors dynamic allocation processor allocation multiprogramming multiprocessing time slicing scheduling conversational systems interactive systems 3.80 4.30 4.31 4.32 6.33 ca700103 jb february 14 1978 2:15 pm
