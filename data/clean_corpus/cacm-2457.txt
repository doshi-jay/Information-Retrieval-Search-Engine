inductive methodsfor proving properties of programs there are two main purposes in this paper first clarification and extension of known results about computation of recursive programs with emphasis on the difference between the theoretical and practical approaches second presentation and examination of various known methods for proving properties of recursive programs discussed in detail are two powerful inductive methods computational induction and structural induction including examples of their applications cacm august 1973 manna z nes s vuillemin j recursive programs least fixed point computational induction structural induction 4.2 5.23 5.24 ca730817 jb january 23 1978 10:24 am
