new sufficient optimality conditions for integer programming and their application the purpose of this report is to present a new class of sufficient optimality conditions for pure and mixed integer programming problems some of the sets of sufficient conditions presented can be thought of as generalizations of optimality conditions based on primal-dual complementarity in linear programming these sufficient conditions are particularly useful for the construction of difficult integer programming problems with known optimal solutions these problems may then be used to test and/or benchmark integer programming codes cacm may 1978 fleisher j meyer r integer programming optimality conditions test problem construction kuhn-tucker conditions greatest common divisor 3.15 5.39 5.49 ca780508 dh february 26 1979 1:19 pm
