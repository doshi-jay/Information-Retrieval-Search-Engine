the use of normal multiplication tables for information storage and retrieval this paper describes a method for the organization and retrieval of attribute based information systems using the normal multiplication table as a directory for the information system algorithms for the organization an d retrieval of information are described this method is particularly suitable for queries requesting a group of information items all of which possess a particular set of attributes and possibly some other attributes as well several examples are given the results with respect to the number of disk accesses and disk space are compared to other common approaches algorithms evaluating the appropriateness of the above approach to a given information system are described for a certain class of information systems the normal multiplication table method yields far more rapid retrieval with a more economical space requirement than conventional systems moreover this method incorporates an improved modification of the inverted file technique cacm march 1979 motzkin d information retrieval inverted files multiattribute retrieval multilist file normal multiplication table queries rapid retrieval space economy 3.70 3.73 3.79 ca790305 dh may 21 1979 9:46 am
