an algorithm for the approximate solution of wiener-hopf integral equations an explicit approximate solution is given for an equation where it is assumed that the classical wiener-hopf technique may be applied it is furthermore assumed that fourier transforms are known explicitly the approximate solution depends on two positive parameters cacm november 1973 stenger f integral equations wiener-hopf convolution approximate solution 5.18 ca731117 jb january 19 1978 3:36 pm
