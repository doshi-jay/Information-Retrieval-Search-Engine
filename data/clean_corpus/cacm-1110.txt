a fourier series method for the numerical solution of a class of parabolic partial differential equations a fourier series method is described which when applied to a certain class of parabolic partial differential equations reduces the problem to a system of ordinary differential equations an application is given for which the method shows a considerable advantage over conventional finite difference methods cacm march 1964 forrington c v d ca640322 jb march 10 1978 2:08 am
