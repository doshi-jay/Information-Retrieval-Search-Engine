a man-machine approach toward solving the traveling salesman problem the traveling salesman problem belongs to an important class of scheduling and routing problems it is also a subproblem in solving others such as the warehouse distribution problem it has been attacked by many mathematical methods with but meager success only for special forms of the problem or for problems with a moderate number of points can it be solved exactly even if very large amounts of computer time are used heuristic procedures have been proposed and tested with only slightly better results this paper describes a computer aided heuristic technique which uses only a modest amount of computer time in real-time to solve large 100-200 point problems this technique takes advantage of both the computers and the humans problem-solving abilities the computer is not asked to solve the problem in a brute force way as in many of todays heuristics but it is asked to organize the data for the human so that the human can solve the problem easily the technique used in this paper seems to point to new directions in the field of man-machine interaction and in the field of artificial intelligence cacm may 1971 krolak p felts w marble g heuristic procedures computer-aided heuristic technique man-machine interaction artificial intelligence assignment problem mask of the assignment rubber band tour generator interaction process traveling salesman problem 3.57 3.66 5.30 ca710503 jb february 3 1978 3:00 pm
