one-pass compilation of arithmetic expressions for a parallel processor under the assumption that a processor may have a multiplicity of arithmetic units a compiler for such a processor should produce object code to take advantage of possible parallelism of operation most of the presently known compilation techniques are inadequate for such a processor because they produce expression structures that must be evaluated serially a technique is presented here for compiling arithmetic expressions into structures that can be evaluated with a high degree of parallelism the algorithm is a variant of the so-called top-down analysis technique and requires only one pass of the input text cacm april 1967 stone h s ca670402 jb february 28 1978 11:36 am
