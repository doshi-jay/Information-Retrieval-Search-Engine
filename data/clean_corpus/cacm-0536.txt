nonlinear regression and the solution of simultaneous equations if one has a set of observables z1zm which are bound in a relation with certain parameters a1an by an equation sz1a10 one frequently has the problem of determining a set of values of the ai which minimizes the sum of squares of differences between observed and calculated values of a distinguished observable say zm if the solution of the above equation for zm zmnz1a1 gives rise to a function n which is nonlinear in the ai then one may rely on a version of gaussian regression 1,2 for an iteration scheme that converges to a minimizing set of values it is shown here that this same minimization technique may be used for the solution of simultaneous not necessarily linear equations cacm july 1962 baer r m ca620725 jb march 17 1978 8:09 pm
