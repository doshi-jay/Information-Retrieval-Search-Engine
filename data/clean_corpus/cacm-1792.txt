exploratory experimental studies comparing online and off line programming performance two exploratory experiments were conducted at system development corporation to compare debugging performance of programmers working under conditions of on-line and off line access to a computer these are the first known studies that measure programmers performance under controlled conditions for standard tasks statistically significant results of both experiments indicated faster debugging under online conditions but perhaps the most important practical finding involves the striking individual differences in programmer performance methodological problems encountered in designing and conducting these experiments are described limitations of the findings are pointed out hypotheses are presented to account for results and suggestions are made for further research cacm january 1968 sackman h erikson w j grant e e online vs off line performance programmer/computer communication programming experimental-empirical studies programming cost effectiveness programming performance debugging effectiveness time sharing vs batch processing factor analysis application programmer trainee performance basic programming knowledge test experienced programmer study analysis of variance programmer individual differences 2.40 ca680101 jb february 23 1978 2:58 pm
