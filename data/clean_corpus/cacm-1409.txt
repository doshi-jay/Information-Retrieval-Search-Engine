nebula a digital computer using a 20 mc glass delay line memory oregon state university has designed and constructed a medium-speed serial digital computer using glass delay lines circulating at 22 mc as memory the design objectives as originally conceived in a special seminar were 1 to be a research project in computer design 2 to be usable as an educational machineand 3 to have easily modifiable hardware for basic research in computer systems design an unusual arrangement of information within the 22 mc memory allows a simple interface with the 340 kc arithmetic unit which results in an effective zero latency time and provides possibilities for an associative memory the arithmetic unit has a command structure similar to large parallel machines and uses flip-flop arithmetic and control registers throughout all hardware development has been aimed toward the concept of easy modification elaborate console controls for effective man-machine interaction and low cost cacm july 1966 boles j a rux p t weingarten jr f w ca660705 jb march 2 1978 9:35 pm
