weighted derivation trees the nodes of a weighted derivation tree are associated with weighting functions over the vocabulary of a context-free grammar an algorithm is presented for constructing the optimal derivation tree having the same structure as a given weighted derivation tree in addition the correctness of the algorithm is established the method may be applied to problems involving probabilistic parsing or combinatorial optimization cacm september 1976 loui m c derivation tree clean tree probabilistic grammar structural ambiguity combinatorial optimization 5.23 5.49 ca760903 jb january 4 1978 9:41 am
