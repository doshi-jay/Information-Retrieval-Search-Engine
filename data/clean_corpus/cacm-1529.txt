decomposition programming an analysis of matrix substructure a petroleum blending problem was analyzed in order to compare the primal and primal-dual decomposition algorithms in the course of the analysis a substructure was discovered which has relevance to the relative performance of the two algorithms and to their absolute performance as compared with a standard primal-simplex solution without decomposition cacm october 1967 bell e j ca671004 jb february 27 1978 2:33 pm
