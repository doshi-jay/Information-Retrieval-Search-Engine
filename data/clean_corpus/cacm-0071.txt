proposal for a feasible programming system this paper proposes designing a programming facility itself involving a digital computer and a program which will assist the preparation of large-scale real-time programs this facility is to be capable of preparing programs for any of a variety of machines having characteristics similar to those of the facilitys computer one of the basic assumptions is that there will be enough random-access storage available to avoid the necessity for segmenting a constructed program in any fashion other than a trivial one while this assumption is somewhat unrealistic it is intended to provide an opportunity to concentrate on the other aspects of program construction the programming system should stress the discovery in source program statements of as many errors as possible before attempting to construct an object program among the computer characteristics which are advocated are a program interrupt scheme a large set of characters and indirect addressing cacm august 1959 bagley p r ca590802 jb march 22 1978 6:16 pm
