multiple precision floating-point conversion from decimal-to-binary and vice versa decimal-to-binary and binary-to-decimal floating-point conversion is often performed by using a table of the powers 10^i ia positive integer for converting from base 10 to base 2 and by using a table of the coefficient of a polynomial approximation of 10^x 0x1 for converting from base 2 to base 10 these tables occupy a large storage region in the case of a nonsingle precision conversion this paper shows that a single small table suffices for a floating-point conversion from decimal to binary and vice versa in any useful precision cacm may 1966 mancino o g ca660507 jb march 3 1978 9:56 am
