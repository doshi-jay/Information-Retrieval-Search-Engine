spline function methods for nonlinear boundary-value problems the solution of the nonlinear differential equation yfxyy with two-point boundary conditions is approximated by a quintic or cubic spline function yx the method is well suited to nonuniform mesh size and dynamic mesh size allocation for uniform mesh size h the error in the quintic spline yx is oh^4 with typical error one-third that from numerovs method requiring the differential equation to be satisfied at the mesh points results in a set of difference equations which are block tridiagonal and so are easily solved by relaxation or other standard methods cacm june 1969 blue j l boundary value problems differential equations finite differences functional approximation iterative methods nonlinear equations spline functions 5.13 5.15 5.17 ca690605 jb february 17 1978 11:07 am
