lg a language for analytic geometry a conversational programming language for analytic geometry is described together with some aspects of its implementation the language allows the flexible definition of geometric objects and elements computes their parameters and displays the results it also provides the capability of specifying a geometric figure via a collection of parameters and displaying various loci corresponding to these parameters a third characteristic consists of the possibility of using this language to design other user oriented languages lg has been specifically designed for use by nonprogrammers it is easy to learn and very close to the natural language used in geometry cacm april 1976 raymond j interactive programming problem oriented languages computer graphics interpreters analytic geometry 3.20 4.13 4.22 4.9 ca760403 jb january 4 1978 4:26 pm
