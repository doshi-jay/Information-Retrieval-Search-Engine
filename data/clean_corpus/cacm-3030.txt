an example of hierarchical design and proof hierarchical programming is being increasingly recognized as helpful in the construction of large programs users of hierarchical techniques claim or predict substantial increases in productivity and in the reliability of the programs produced in this paper we describe a formal method for hierarchical program specification implementation and proof we apply this method to a significant list processing problem and also discuss a number of extensions to current programming languages that ease hierarchical program design and proof cacm december 1978 spitzen j levitt k robinson l program verification specification data abstraction software modules hierarchical structures 4.0 4.6 5.21 5.24 ca781209 dh january 16 19794:43 pm
