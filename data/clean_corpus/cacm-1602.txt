pose a language for posing problems to a computer a language pose is described which is a drastic departure from the fortran/algol type though it does utilize fortran formula and logic representations and actually contains fortran vi as a subset with the new language the user need only describe his problem in equation-like form the method of solution is automatically provided in conjunction with the translation from equation form to computer instruction in this way the pose language user can solve difficult computational problems like the solution of differential equation without requiring a knowledge of numerical methods or the intricacies of computer subroutine logic essentially all clerical operations now required for fortran programming have been automated so that the pose programmer need not be concerned with these details cacm may 1967 schlesinger s sashkin l ca670504 jb february 28 1978 10:53 am
