variable width stacks character addressable variable field computers permit ready establishment and manipulation of variable width stacks single machine commands may push variable field items down into such stacks or pop them up the availability of a variety of field delimiters allows the machine to push down or pop up more than one variable width item with one command since these stacking operations can be made the basis of compiler decoding algorithms the proper use of machines of this class for compilation has advantages over machines with fixed-length words cacm october 1963 rotenberg n opler a ca631006 jb march 13 1978 6:25 pm
