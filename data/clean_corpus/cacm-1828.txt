synchronization in a parallel-accessed data base the following problem is considered given a data base which can be manipulated simultaneously by more than one process what are the rules for synchronization which will maximize the amount of parallel activity allowed it is assumed that the data base can be represented as a graph an example of such a data base is a hierarchy of directories for an on-line file system methods for synchronization of processes are examined their validity is discussed and their performance compared cacm november 1969 shoshani a bernstein a j parallel accessing parallel search file search data base synchronization locking deadlock 3.73 3.74 4.32 ca691102 jb february 15 1978 1:13 pm
