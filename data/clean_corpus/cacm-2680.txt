optimal space allocation on disk storage devices when the amount of space required for file storage exceeds the amount which can be kept on-line decisions must be made as to which files are to be permanently resident and which mountable these decisions will affect the number of mount requests issued to the operators this is often a bottleneck in a computing facility and reducing the number of mounts thus decreases turnaround time an optimization model for the assignment of files to disk packs and packs to either resident or nonresident status is presented heuristics are suggested for those cases in which it is inefficient to compute the actual optimum cacm march 1974 morgan h l disk analysis disk optimization disk filesfile systems file scheduling space allocation memory hierarchy 3.72 3.73 4.39 ca740303 jb january 18 1978 12:32 pm
