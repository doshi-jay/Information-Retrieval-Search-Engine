boundary networks a feasible computer procedure is described for determining the total or partial inclusion of arbitrarily given points and lines with respect to a set of general polygonal domains which partition a plane bounded region a scheme for the computer representation of the boundaries of the domains and an algorithm based on this scheme for evaluating the inclusion relations are specified in detail the method employs several levels of selection criteria for the purpose of reducing the number of accesses to auxiliary storage devices and the amount of boundary data for which processing is required cacm january 1965 loomis r g ca650111 jb march 8 1978 2:31 pm
