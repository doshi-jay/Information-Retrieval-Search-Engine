reducing truncation errors using cascading accumulators when accumulating a large number of quantities as in numerical integration the sum itself may become much larger than the individual addends this results in truncation error much of this error can be eliminated using cascading accumulators as noted in a recent article by wolfe a simpler and slightly more flexible algorithm is presented which deals also with the case of negative addends cacm january 1965 ross d r ca650104 jb march 8 1978 2:54 pm
