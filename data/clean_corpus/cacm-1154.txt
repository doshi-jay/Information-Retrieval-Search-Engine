multi-tape and infinite-state automata  a survey a survey of machines which are more powerful than finite automata and less powerful than general turing machines is presented it is felt that the machines in this category are as closely related to digital computers as either the finite automata or the unrestricted turing machines intermediate machines can be created by adjoining on infinite-state memory to a finite-state machine and then performing any or all of the following 1 restrict the manner in which the unbounded portion of the memory can be accessed 2 bound the number of steps allowed for a computation by some increasing recursive function of the length of the input 3 restrict the total amount of memory available in the same manner examples from all three classes and their properties are discussed cacm december 1965 fischer p c ca651215 jb march 6 1978 3:24 pm
