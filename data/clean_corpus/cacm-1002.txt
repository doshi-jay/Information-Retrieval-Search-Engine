a rapid method for digital filtering since much of the computer time spent in time-series analysis is used for multiplications a minimum multiplication method was devised for digital filtering with the expectation that it would be useful in the on line real-time analysis of biological data the filters are constructed from a succession of readily analyzable components in a manner that facilitates cascading the repertoire of frequency response curves includes relatively good low-pass and band-pass designs programs are available for implementing both the synthesis of these filters and their application on computers whose assemblers allow the definition of recursive macros cacm september 1964 whittlesey j r b ca640909 jb march 9 1978 5:03 pm
