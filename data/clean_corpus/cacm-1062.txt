symbol manipulation in fortran-sasp i subroutines a set of subroutines for use in fortran are described whose purpose is to synthesize output strings from i input strings which have been analyzed by the shadow general syntactic analysis subroutine reported earlier and/or ii packed bcd strings formed in any way function-type subroutines are included for intermediate manipulations which are performed on the strings which are stored in an abbreviated internal representation the automatic way in which an internal representation for each newly created substring is stored sequentially in a block of common storage and the manner in which a storage block is dynamically allocated for that purpose are discussed cacm june 1964 bailey m j barnett m p burleson p b ca640605 jb march 9 1978 9:43 pm
