analysis of the availability of computer systems using computer aided algebra analytical results related to the availability of a computer system constructed of unreliable processors are presented in this paper these results are obtained by using various computer-aided algebraic manipulation techniques a major purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the difficulties of obtaining analytical solutions to markov processes can be considerably reduced by the application of symbol manipulation programs since many physical systems can be modeled by markov and semi-markov processes the potential range of application of these techniques is much wider than the problem of availability analyzed here cacm july 1978 chattergy r pooch u computer-aided algebra symbol manipulation markov process reliability redundant structures on-line computer system 3.82 5.5 5.7 8.1 8.3 ca780710 dh february 7 1979 3:37 pm
