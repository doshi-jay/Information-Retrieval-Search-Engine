on the interface between computers and data communications systems future systems that combine computers digital terminals and communications equipment present design optimization problems that require reconsideration of the traditional functional responsibilities of the respective subsystems several standard interfaces by means of which computers and digital terminals connect to the communications systems will be required when specifying these interfaces consideration must be given to problems of coordination synchronization error control signaling stream multiplexing and switch control in addition to minimizing the technological interdependence of specific subsystem designs a focus on some of the problems is obtained in a discussion of a detailed specification for a particular computer-communications system interface cacm july 1972 fraser a g communications standard interface communications protocol virtual channel multiplexed input/output coordination of input/output 3.81 6.0 6.35 ca720707 jb january 30 1978 2:46 pm
