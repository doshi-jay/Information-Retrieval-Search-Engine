a method of bivariate interpolation and smooth surface fitting based on local procedures a method is designed for interpolating values given at points of a rectangular grid in a plane by a smooth bivariate function zzxy the interpolating function is a bicubic polynomial in each cell of the rectangular grid emphasis is an avoiding excessive undulation between given grid points the proposed method is an extension of the method of univariate interpolation developed earlier by the author and is likewise based on local procedures cacm january 1974 akima h bivariate interpolation interpolation partial derivative polynomial smooth surface fitting 5.13 ca740103 jb january 18 1978 2:38 pm
