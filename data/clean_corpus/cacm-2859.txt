interference in multiprocessor computer systems with interleaved memory this paper analyzes the memory interference caused by several processors simultaneously using several memory modules exect results are computed for a simple model of such a system the limiting value is derived for the relative degree of memory interference as the system size increases the model of the limiting behavior of the system yields approximate results for the simple model and also suggests that the results are valid for a much larger class of models including those more nearly like real systems that the simple model are tested against some measurements of program behavior and simulations of systems using memory references from real programs the model results provide a good indication of the performance that should be expected from real system of this type cacm june 1976 baskett f smith a j memory memory interference multiprocessing interleaved memory trace driven simulation 4.32 6.21 6.34 8.1 ca760603 jb january 4 1978 2:19 pm
