computer simulation-discussion of the technique and comparison of languages the purpose of this paper is to present a comparison of some computer simulation languages and of some of the involved in comparing software packages for digital computers are discussed in part i the issue is obvious users of digital computers must choose from available languages or write their own substantial costs can occur particularly in training implementation and computer time if an inappropriate language is chosenore and more computer simulation languages are being developed comparisons and evaluations of existing languages are useful for designers and implementers as well as users the second part is devoted to computer simulation and simulation languages the computational characteristics of simulation are discussed with special attention being paid to a distinction between continuous and discrete change models part iii presents a detailed comparison of six simulation languages and packages simscript clp csl gasp cpss and sol the characteristics of each are summarized in a series of tables the implications of this analysis for designers of languages for users and for implementers are developed the conclusion of the paper is that the packages now available for computer simulation offer features which none of the more general-purpose packages do and that analysis of strengths and weaknesses of each suggests ways in which both current and future simulation languages and packages can be improved cacm october 1966 teichroew d lubin j f ca661001 jb march 2 1978 4:23 pm
