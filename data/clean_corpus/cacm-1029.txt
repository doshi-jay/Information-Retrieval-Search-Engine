a simple automatic derivative evaluation program a procedure for automatic evaluation of total/partial derivatives of arbitrary algebraic functions is presented the technique permits computation of numerical values of derivatives without developing analytical expressions for the derivatives the key to the method is the decomposition of the given function by introduction of intermediate variables into a series of elementary functional steps a library of elementary function subroutines is provided for the automatic evaluation and differentiation of these new variables the final step in this process produces the desired functions derivative the main feature of this approach is its simplicity it can be used as a quick-reaction tool where the derivation of analytical derivatives is laborious and also as a debugging tool for programs which contain derivatives cacm august 1964 wengert r e ca640801 jb march 9 1978 7:38 pm
