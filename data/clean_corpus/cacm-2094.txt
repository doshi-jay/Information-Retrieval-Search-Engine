on an algorithm for nonlinear minimax approximation certain nonlinear minimax approximation problems are characterize d by properties which permit the application of special algorithms mainly based on the exchange algorithms of remes 1934 1935 for their solution in this paper the application to problems of this type of a general nonlinear algorithm due to osborne and watson 1969 is considered examples are given to illustrate that this algorithm can give satisfactory results and in particular can successfully solve problems which lead to difficulties with the more conventional specialist method cacm march 1970 watson g a minimax approximation nonlinear approximation linear programming 5.13 5.41 ca700304 jb february 13 1978 4:52 pm
