algorithm and bound for the greatest common divisor of n integers a new version of the euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of n integers ai and multipliers xi such that gcd  x1a1 +  + xnan is presented the number of arithmetic operations and the number of storage locations are linear in n a theorem of lame that gives a bound for the number of iterations of the euclidean algorithm for two integers is extended to the case of n integers an algorithm to construct a minimal set of multipliers is presented a fortran program for the algorithm appears as comm acm algorithm 386 cacm july 1970 bradley g h greatest common divisor euclidean algorithm number theory diophantine equations 3.15 5.10 ca700706 jb february 13 1978 8:45 am
