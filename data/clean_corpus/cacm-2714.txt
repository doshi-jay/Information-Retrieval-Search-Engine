merging with parallel processors consider two linearly ordered sets a b am bn mn and p pm parallel processors working synchronously the paper presents an algorithm for merging a and b with the p parallel processors which requires at most 2log2 2m+1+3m/p + m/plog2 n/m steps if n  2^bm b an integer the algorithm requires at most 2log2 m+1 + m/p2+b steps in the case where m and n are of the same order of magnitude ie nkm with k being a constant the algorithm requires 2log2 m+1 + m/p3+k steps these performances compare very favorably with the previous best parallel merging algorithm batchers algorithm which requires n/p + m+n/2plog2 m steps in the general case and km/p + k+1/2m/plog2 m in the special case where nkm cacm october 1975 gavril f parallel processing parallel merging parallel binary insertion 5.31 ca751005 jb january 6 1978 10:50 am
