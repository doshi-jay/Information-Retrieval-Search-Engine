a comparative study of computer programs for integrating differential equations a study comparing the performance of several computer programs for integrating systems of ordinary differential equations is reported the integration methods represented include multistep methods predictor-correctors single-step methods runge-kutta and extrapolation methods both polynomial and rational the testing procedure is described together with the evaluation criteria applied a set of test problems on which the programs were tested is included in an appendix for the particular problems and criteria used in the investigation it was found that a program based on rational extrapolation showed the best performance cacm november 1972 fox p ordinary differential equations integration program comparison certification validation 5.10 5.17 ca721101 jb january 27 1978 2:45 pm
