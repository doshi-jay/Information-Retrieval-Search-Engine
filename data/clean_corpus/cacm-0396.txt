automation of program debugging automatic debugging can substantially reduce lead-time between the coding and the effective use of a complex program it also enforces analysis of debugging criteria resulting in verifiably accurate programs the programmer specifies the program to be debugged memory areas set of input data maximum repetition of loops and checkpoint information for each set of data the executive debugging program the runs the program to be debugged performing checking functions and creating a trace record of its own later analysis and location of errors applications are quite flexible and the system can be used alone or in conjunction with other debugging techniques cacm july 1961 jacoby k layton h ca610714 es march 17 1982 10:10 am
