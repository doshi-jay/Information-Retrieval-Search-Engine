the optimal approach to recursive programs the classical fixed poin t approach toward recursive programs suggests choosing the least defined fixed poin t as the most appropriate solution to a recursive program a new approach is described which in troduction an  optimal fixed point which in contrast to the least defined fixed poin t embodies the maximal amount of valuable information embedded in the program the practical implications of this approach are discussed and techniques for proving properties of optimal fixed poin t are given the presentation is informal with emphasis on examples cacm november 1977 manna z shamir a recursive programs fixed poin ts least fixedpoints optimal fixed poin ts proof techniques 5.24 ca771109 jb december 27 1977 7:13 am
