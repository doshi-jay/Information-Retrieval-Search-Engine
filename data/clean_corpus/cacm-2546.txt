the use of grammatical inference for designing programming languages both in designing a new programming language and in extending an existing language the designer is faced with the problem of deriving a natural grammar for the language we are proposing an interactive approach to the grammar design problem wherein the designer presents a sample of sentences and structures as input to a grammatical inference algorithm the algorithm then constructs a grammar which is a reasonable generalization of the examples submitted by the designer the implementation is presently restricted to a subclass of operator precedence grammars but a second algorithm is outlined which applies to a larger class of context-free grammars cacm february 1973 crespi-reghizzi s melkanoff m a lichten l grammar design language definition inference identification in the limit extensible languages 3.61 4.2 5.23 ca730202 jb january 24 1978 3:20 pm
