some effects of the 6600 computer on language structures the problem of compiling efficient 6600 codes prompted the development of an intermediate language reflecting the structure of the machine that is more easily manipulated in improving object program efficiency the subject of this paper is the intermediate language and methods of manipulating it compilations of a series of arithmetic statements are discussed it is assumed that all functions and exponentials have been removed from these statements and replaced by simple variables for purposes of simplicity the treatment of subscripts is ignored a simplified 6600 structure is presented to illustrate the compiling method several assumptions are made for purposes of simplification although there are cases in which the assumptions are violated in the actual machine cacm february 1964 allard r w wolf k a zemlin r a ca640209 jb march 10 1978 3:54 am
