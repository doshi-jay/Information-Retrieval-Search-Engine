modeling and simulation of digital networks the simulation of digital networks on a digital computer provides the engineer with an effective means of analyzing time-quantized logical behavior the digital network is modeled as a set of time-dependent or time-independent boolean transformations each transformation describing the input-output relationship of a model element comprising the network mode the simplicity of utilizing the fortran iv programming system as a digital network simulator is discussed an illustrated this simplicity is derived from a common modeling technique applicable to combinational and sequential digital networks and a systematic programming approach cacm may 1965 larsen r p mano m m ca650510 jb march 7 1978 1:15 pm
