an algorithm for finding a fundamental set of cycles of a graph a fast method is presented for finding a fundamental set of cycles for an undirected finite graph a spanning tree is grown and the vertices examined in turn unexamined vertices being stored in a pushdown list to await examination one stage in the process is to take the top element v of the pushdown list and examine it ie inspect all those edges vz of the graph for which z has not yet been examined if z is already in the tree a fundamental cycle is added if not the edge vz is placed in the tree there is exactly one such stage for each of the n vertices of the graph for large n the store required in creases as n^2 and the time as n^g where g depends on the type of graph involved g is bounded below by 2 and above by 3 and it is shown that both bounds are attained in terms of storage our algorithm is similar to that of gotlieb and corneil and superior to that of welch in terms of speed it is similar to that of welch and superior to that of gotlieb and corneil testsshow our algorithm to be remarkably efficient g2 on random graphs cacm september 1969 paton k fundamental cycle set graph algorithm cycle spanning tree 5.32 ca690909 jb february 15 1978 4:29 pm
