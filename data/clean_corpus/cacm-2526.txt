asymmetric memory hierarchies a study is presented of some of the system implications of memory hierarchies in which the backing or secondary store has a very small read time relative of both the time required for writing and to the read time of conventional backing storage devices several analytic models are introduced and it is shown that such hierarchies may operate in ways which differ from those of more conventional hierarchies in particular it is shown that it may not be necessary to multiprogram in such a situation in the past backing storage devices have been roughly symmetric with respect to their read and write times this situation may not continue as several devices are currently under development which may have a very small read-time/write-time ratio this study places particular emphasis on one such system-the rca read/write holographic optical memory cacm april 1973 williams j asymmetric memory hierarchy demand paging holographic optical memory memory device memory hierarchy paging storage device storage hierarchy virtual memory 4.3 4.32 5.2 6.2 6.34 ca730402 jb january 24 1978 10:15 am
