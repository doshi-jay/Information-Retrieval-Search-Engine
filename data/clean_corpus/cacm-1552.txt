the aed free storage package the most fundamental underlying problem in sophisticated software systems involving elaborate changing data structure is dynamic storage allocation for flexible problem modeling the free storage package of the aed-1 compiler systems allows blocks of available storage to be obtained and returned for reuse the total available space is partitioned into a hierarchy of free storage zones each of which has its own characteristics blocks may be of any size and special provisions allow efficient handling of selected sizes control of shattering and garbage collection and sharing of physical space between zones the routines of the package perform high level functions automatically but also allow access and control of fine internal details as well cacm august 1967 ross d t ca670803 jb february 27 1978 4:40 pm
