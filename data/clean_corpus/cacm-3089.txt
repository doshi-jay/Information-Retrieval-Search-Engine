performance of rollback recovery systems under intermittent failures a mathematical model of a transaction-oriented system under intermittent failures is proposed the system is assumed to operate with a checkpointing and rollback/recovery method to ensure reliable information processing the model is used to derive the principal performance measures including availability response time and the system saturation point cacm june 1978 gelenbe e derochette d database reliability file systems checkpoints recovery procedures checking techniques reliability and system performance evaluation 3.72 3.73 4.33 4.35 4.6 5.5 8.1 ca780608 dh february 9 1979 10:26 am
