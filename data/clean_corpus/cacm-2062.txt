the application of sequential sampling to simulation an example inventory model four different sequential sampling procedures are applied to the analysis of data generated by a computer simulation experiment with a multi-item inventory model for each procedure the cost of computer time required to achieve given levels of statistical precision is calculated also the cost of computer time using comparable fixed sample size methods is calculated the computer costs of fixed sample size procedures versus sequential sampling procedures are compared cacm may 1970 sasser w e burdick d s graham d a naylor t h simulation inventory models sequential sampling models experimental design 3.31 3.50 3.54 5.5 ca700504 jb february 13 1978 2:11 pm
