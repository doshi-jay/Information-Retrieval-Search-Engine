focus microcomputer number system focus is a number system and supporting computational algorithms especially useful for microcomputer control and other signal processing applications focus has the wide-ranging character of floating-point numbers with a uniformity of state distributions that give focus better than a twofold accuracy advantage over an equal word length floating-point system focus computations are typically five times faster than single precision fixed-point or integer arithmetic for a mixture of operations comparable in speed with hardware arithmetic for many applications algorithms for 8-bit and 16-bit implementations of focus are included cacm march 1979 edgar a lee s number representation logarithmic arithmetic computational speed computational accuracy microcomputer applications 3.24 3.80 4.0 4.22 5.11 ca790302 dh april 12 1979 11:12 am
