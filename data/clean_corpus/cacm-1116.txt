tests on a computer method for constructing school timetables a previously proposed computer method for constructing timetables based on an iteration involving boolean matrices is described in limited tests the method has successfully produced timetables on every trial references are given which relate the timetable problem to theorems on matrices of zeros and ones and to theorems on bipartite graphs some problems of applying the method to constructing timetables in real situations are noted cacm march 1964 csima j gotlieb c c ca640316 jb march 10 1978 2:34 am
