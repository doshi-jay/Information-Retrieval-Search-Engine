achieving specific accuracy in simulation output analysis this paper extends the use of the regenerative property of queueing systems in the analysis of simulation output in particular it describes a sequential estimation method which when used with the regenerative property allows results to be obtained with specified statistical accuracy this method includes a test to check the normality assumption on which the sequential procedure relies the paper illustrates the method using the empty and idle state as the regenerative state a second example then describes how using the most frequently entered state as the regenerative state reduces the chance of making a costly error in a preliminary simulation run the paper also described how a variance reduction method due to page 9 can be used to obtain a specified accuracy with considerably fewer job completions than are required when no variance reduction technique is applied cacm may 1977 fishman g s confidence in terval ratio estimator regenerative property sequential estimator simulation stopping rule variance reduction 5.5 8.1 ca770502 jb december 29 1977 2:43 am
