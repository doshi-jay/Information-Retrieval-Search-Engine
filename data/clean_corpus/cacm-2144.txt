on accurate floating-point summation the accumulation of floating-point sums is considered on a computer which performs t-digit base b floating-point addition with exponents in the range -m to m an algorithm is given for accurately summing n t-digit floating-point numbers each of these n numbers is split into q parts forming qn t-digit floating-point numbers each of these is then added to the appropriate one of n auxiliary t-digit accumulators finally the accumulators are added together to yield the computed sum in all qn+n-1 t-digit floating-point additions are performed under usual conditions the relative error in the computed sum is at most t+1/vb^1-t for some v further with an additional q+n-1 t-digit additions the computed sum can be corrected to full t-digit accuracy for example for the ibm/360 b16 t14 m63 m64 typical values for q and n are q2 and n32 in this case  becomes n  32,768 and we have t+1/vb^1-t  4x16^-13 cacm november 1971 malcolm m a floating-point summation error analysis 5.11 5.19 ca711105 jb february 2 1978 10:48 am
