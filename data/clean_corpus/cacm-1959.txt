an interrupt based organization for management information systems a programming structure language constructs and a supervisory system organization are proposed for the design and coding of large shared data base systems the bases for this organization are a generalized interrupt structure and the newly introduced concept of file tagging which is the process of associating program structures and interrupt generating conditions with items in the data base an algorithm for resolving conflicts which arise in scheduling the interrupt processing routines is presented dpl a programming language and supervisory system in which these concepts are implemented is used to illustrated the new organization which is proposed for management information systems cacm december 1970 morgan h l management information systems integrated data processing supervisors interrupts monitoring systems supervisory systems interrupt scheduling parallel processing 3.51 4.22 4.32 ca701204 jb february 9 1978 3:46 pm
