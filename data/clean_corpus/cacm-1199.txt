a computer center simulation project todays computation centers are based on rapidly changing technologies of hardware and software systems it is difficult therefore to base decisions on experience in most instances the benefits of comparable experience for a given problem situation are not available in this paper a mathematical model of the lockheed central computer center is formulated that describes the operation of a computation center in terms of information nets decision processes and control functions experiments performed with this model the results of the experiments and the application of the results are discussed cacm september 1965 hutchinson g k ca650907jb march 6 1978 7:29 pm
