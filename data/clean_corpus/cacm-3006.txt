anomalies with variable partition paging algorithms five types of anomalous behavior which may occur in paged virtual memory operating systems a redefined one type of anomaly for example concerns the fact that with certain reference strings and paging algorithms an increase in mean memory allocation may result in an increase in fault rate two paging algorithms are examined in terms of their anomaly potential and reference string examples of various anomalies are presented two paging algorithm properties the inclusion property and the generalized inclusion property are discussed and the anomaly implications of these properties presented cacm march 1978 franklin m graham g gupta r anomaly memory management program behavior stack algorithms virtual memory working set page fault frequency paging algorithms 4.32 4.35 4.6 8.1 ca780307 jb march 28,1978 1:01 pm
