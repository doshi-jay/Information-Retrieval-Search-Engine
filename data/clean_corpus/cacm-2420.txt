experiments with an automatic theorem-prover havingpartial ordering inference rules automatic theorem-provers need to be made much more efficient with this in mind slagle has shown how the axioms for partial ordering can be replaced by built-in inference rules when using a particular theorem-proving algorithm based upon hyper-resolution and paramodulation the new rules embody the transitivity of partial orderings and the close relationship between predicates a program has been developed using a modified version of these rules this new theorem-prover has been found to be very powerful for solving problems involving partial orderings this paper presents a detailed description of the program and a comprehensive account of the experiments that have been performed with it cacm november 1973 slagle j r norton l m theorem-proving partial ordering resolution hyper-resolution p1-resolution paramodulation inference rules heuristics 3.64 3.66 ca731106 jb january 20 1978 10:10 am
