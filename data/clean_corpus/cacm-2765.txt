analysis and performance of inverted data base structures the need to envision and architecture data base systems in a hierarchical level by level framework is stressed the inverted data base file organization is then analyzed considering implementation oriented aspects the inverted directory is viewed realistically as another large data base which itself is subjected to inversion formulations are derived to estimate average access time read only and storage requirements formalizing the interaction of data base content characteristics logical complexity of queries and machine timing and blocking specifications identified as having a first-order effect on performance the formulations presented are necessary to be used in conjunction with any index selection criteria to determine the optimum set of index keys cacm may 1975 cardenas a f data base architecture inverted file organization data base performance and measurement secondary index organization information storage and retrieval query answering 3.70 3.71 3.72 3.74 3.79 4.0 ca750502 jb january 9 1978 3:15 pm
