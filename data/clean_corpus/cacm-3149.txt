the cyclic order property of vertices as an aid in scene analysis a cyclic-order property is defined for bodies bounded by smooth-curved faces the property is shown to be useful for analyzing pictures of such bodies particularly when the line data extracted from the pictures are imperfect this property augments previously known grammatical rules that determine the existence of three-dimensional bodies corresponding to given two-dimensional line-structure data cacm june 1979 shapira r freeman h scene analysis cyclic order artificial intelligence three-dimensional reconstruction  picture processing computer graphics pattern recognition 3.2 3.6 8.2 ca790605 dh august 22 1979 1:36 pm
