symbolic factoring of polynomials in several variables an algorithm for finding the symbolic factors of a multi-variate polynomial with integer coefficients is presented the algorithm is an extension of a technique used by kronecker in a proof that the prime factoring of any polynomial may be found in a finite number of steps the algorithm consists of factoring single-variable instances of the given polynomial by kroneckers method and introducing the remaining variables by interpolation techniques for implementing the algorithm and several examples are discussed the algorithm promises sufficient power to be used efficiently in an online system for symbolic mathematics cacm august 1966 jordan d e kain r y clapp l c ca660812 jb march 2 1978 7:06 pm
