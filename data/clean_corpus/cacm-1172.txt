conversion of limited-entry decision tables to computer programs decision tables are useful for describing a set of complex decision rules based on given sets of conditions algorithms that can efficiently convert the tables into computer programs will extend the usefulness of decision tables to computer users two such algorithms based on work done by m s montalbano are described and extended here to handle dashes and else-decision rules the first algorithm minimizes the computer storage space required for the resultant program the second minimizes computer running time during the conversion process both pinpoint any contradictions or redundancies among the rules in a table cacm november 1965 pollack s l ca651109 jb march 6 1978 4:56 pm
