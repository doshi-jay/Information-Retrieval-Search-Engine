a comparison of list-processing computer languages including a detailed comparison of comit ipl-v lisp 1.5 and slip a detailed comparison is presented of comit ipl-v lisp 1.5 and slip  four well-known computer programming languages which among them exhibit all the principal characteristics of existing list-processing languages important common features of list-processing languages are reviewed forms of data structures which are manipulated necessity for dynamic allocation of storage use of pushdown stores and use of recursive operations principal differences between the four languages under consideration are detailed representations of data both by the programmer and within the machine methods for storage allocation programming formalisms and special processes available including arithmetic facilities and usability in terms of availability documentation learning aids and debugging facilities a rough comparison shows that all the languages discussed have approximately the same speed finally the authors give some heuristics to aid in the selection of one of these languages for use in particular problem applications concluding that no one of the languages considered is distinctly superior in all possible list-processing applications cacm april 1964 bobrow d g raphael b ca640410 jb march 10 1978 1:37 am
