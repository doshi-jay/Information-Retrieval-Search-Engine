extremely portable random number generator extremely portable subroutines are sometimes needed for which moderate quality and efficiency suffice typically this occurs for library functions like random number generation and in core sorting which are not entirely universal or are not used in a standardized way the literature on random number generators does not seem to contain an algorithm that meets requirements of this sort an extremely portable 8-line fortran program is provided which based on an important paper by coveyou and macpherson 1967sing their methods fourier analysis is applied to the probability function for the consecutive n-tuples provided by our generator with n less than or equal to 4 while the small modulus which must be used to maintain portability prevents the quality of the generator from being high the generator compares well with the bounds established in the above mentioned paper cacm february 1969 kruskal j b random number generators random numbers random number analysis random generators linear sequential generators random number program pseudo random numbers 4.49 5.19 5.5 ca690208 jb february 20 1978 10:43 am
