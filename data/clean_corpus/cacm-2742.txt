improved event-scanning mechanisms for discrete event simulation simulation models of large complex real-world applications have occasionally earned the reputation of eating up hours of computer time this problem may be attributed in part to difficulties such as slow stochastic convergence however an additional problem lies in the fact that a significant amount of bookkeeping time is required to keep future events in their proper sequence this paper presents a method for significantly reducing the time spent scanning future event lists in discrete event simulations there models are presented all of which improve in effectiveness as the events-list scan problem becomes more burdensome cacm june 1975 wyman f p discrete event simulation simulation event scanning mechanisms 4.34 5.5 8.1 ca750611 jb january 9 1978 12:43 pm
