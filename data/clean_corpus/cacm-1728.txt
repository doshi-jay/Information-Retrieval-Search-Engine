further experimental data on the behavior of programs in a paging environment results are summarized from an empirical study directed at the measurement of program operating behavior in those multiprogramming systems in which programs are organized into fixed length pages the data collected from the interpretive execution of a number of paged programs are used to describe the frequency of page faults ie the frequency of those instants at which an executing program requires a page of data or instructions not in main core memory these data are used also for the evaluation of page replacement algorithms and for assessing the effects on performance of changes in the amount of storage allocated to executing programs cacm july 1968 coffman e g varian l c paging systems paging dynamic program behavior program behavior virtual memory systems single-level storage one-level storage operating system simulation operating systems supervisor simulation machine language program interpretation 4.13 4.32 4.39 4.9 ca680701 jb february 22 1978 3:13 pm
