conversion of limited-entry decision tables to computer programs-a proposed modification to pollacks algorithm pollack has proposed an algorithm for converting decision tables into flowcharts which minimize subsequent execution time when compiled into a computer program two modifications of this algorithm are proposed the first relies on shannons noiseless coding theorem and the communications concept of entropy but does not completely test the else rule the second modification completely tests the else rule but results in more executions than the first modification both modifications result in modification guarantees a globally optimal solution cacm february 1971 shwayder k coding decision table entropy information theory noiseless channel sorting 3.50 5.31 ca710201 jb february 8 1978 10:06 am
