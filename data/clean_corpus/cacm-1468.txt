syntax-directed interpretation of classes of pictures a descriptive scheme for classes of pictures based on labeling techniques using parallel processing algorithms was proposed by the author some years ago since then much work has been done in applying this to bubble chamber pictures the parallel processing simulator originally written for an ibm 7094 system has now been rewritten for a cdc 3600 system this paper descriptive models by considering their specific application to bubble chamber pictures how the description generated in this phase can be embedded in a larger conversation program is explained by means of a certain specific example that has been worked out a partial generative grammar for handwritten english letters is given as are also a few computer-generated outputs using this grammar and the parallel processing simulator mentioned earlier cacm march 1966 narasimhan r ca660304 jb march 3 1978 1:56 pm
