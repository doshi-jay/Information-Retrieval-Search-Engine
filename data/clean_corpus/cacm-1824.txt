aparel-a parse-request language aparel is described this language is an extension to an algorithmic language pl/i that provides the pattern-matching capabilities normally found only in special purpose languages such as snobol4 and tmg this capability is provided through clean-requests stated in a bnf-like format these clean-requests form their own programming language with special sequencing rules upon successfully completing a clean-request an associated piece of pl/i code is executed this code has available for use as normal pl/i strings the various pieces at all levels of the clean it also has available as normal pl/i variables the information concerning which of the various alternatives were successful convenient facilities for multiple input-output streams the initiation of sequences of clean-requests as a subroutine and clean-time semantic checks are also included aparel has proven convenient in building a powerful syntax and function macro system an algebraic language preprocessor debugging system an on-line command parser a translator for dataless programming and as a general string manipulator cacm november 1969 balzer r m farber d j text processing string processing symbol manipulation pl/i bnf syntax parser translator pattern matching 4.12 4.13 4.20 4.22 4.29 ca691106 jb february 15 1978 12:44 pm
