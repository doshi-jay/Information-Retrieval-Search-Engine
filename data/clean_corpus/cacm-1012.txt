formal parsing systems automatic syntactic analysis has recently become important for both natural language data processing and syntax-directed compilers a formal parsing system g  vutr consists of two finite disjoint vocabularies v and t a many-many map u from v onto t and a recursive set r of strings in t called syntactic sentence classes every program for automatic syntactic analysis determines a formal parsing system a directed production analyzer itxp is a nondeterministic pushdown-store machine with internal vocabulary i input vocabulary t and all productions of p in the form za  ay1  ym where z yi are elements of the set i and a is an element of the set t every context-free language can be analyzed by a directed production analyzer the kuno-oettinger multiple-path syntactic analyzer for english is a concrete example of a directed production analyzer and of a working parsing algorithm the connection between structures assigned by the analyzer and those of a conventional phrase structure grammar is examined in this paper cacm august 1964 greibach s a ca640818 jb march 9 1978 6:30 pm
