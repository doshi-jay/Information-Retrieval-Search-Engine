time clocks and the ordering of events in a distributed system the concept of one event happening before another in a distributed system is examined and is shown to define a partial ordering of the events a distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally order the events the use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization problems the algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the clocks can become cacm july 1978 lamport l distributed systems computer networks clock synchronization multiprocess systems 4.32 5.29 ca780706 dh february 7 1979 4:30 pm
