recursion analysis for compiler optimization a relatively simple method for the detection of recursive use of procedures is presented for use in compiler optimization implementation considerations are discussed and a modification of the algorithm is given to further improve optimization this analysis can also be used to determine what possible subset of values could be assumed by variables which can only take on a relatively small discrete set of values the most common are parameters of variables assuming values of label procedure or pascals enumerated type cacm september 1976 walter k g recursion compiler optimization 4.12 ca760904 jb january 4 1978 9:36 am
