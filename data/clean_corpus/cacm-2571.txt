an analytic model of the hasp execution task monitor the hasp execution task monitor periodically rearranges the os/360 dispatching chain to give tasks preemptive execution priority in inverse order to that of their cpu utilization history the effect is to keep the i/o bound tasks active and to prevent cpu bound tasks from locking out other tasks this paper develops a simple model of the execution task monitor and employs it to study the effectiveness of the monitor in improving system performance a modified strategy monitor control is investigated for the case of task execution in a memory hierarchy of varying speeds cacm december 1974 strauss j c hasp os/360 dispatching scheduling modeling performance evaluation 4.32 8.1 ca741203 jb january 16 1978 9:51 am
