preliminary report on a system for general space planning a computer language and a set of programs within that language are described which allow the formulating and solving of a class of space planning problems the language is an extension of algol and includes means to represent spaces and objects to manipulate them and to test the resulting arrangements according to a variety of constraints the algorithms used to solve problems expressed in this language rely on heuristic programming both the language and the search algorithms are detailed cacm february 1972 eastman c m automated design architecture heuristic programs space planning 3.20 3.40 3.64 3.66 ca720202 jb january 31 1978 4:35 pm
