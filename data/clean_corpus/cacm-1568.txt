plotting a function of three independent variables a method is developed for constructing an approximate plot of a function of three independent variables the plot is similar to a conventional contour map except that there are three scales to represent the independent variables scale values of the three independent variables are added vectorially and the value of the function is then read from the values associated with nearby contours cacm july,1967 stineman r w ca670705 jb february 28 1978 8:59 am
