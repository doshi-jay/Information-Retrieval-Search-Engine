parallel numerical methods for the solution of equations classical iterative procedures for the numerical solution of equations provide at each stage a single new approximation to the root in question a technique is given for the development of numerical procedures which provide at each stage several approximations to a solution of an equation the s8everal approximations obtained in any iteration are computationally independent making the methods of interest in a parallel processing environment convergence is insured by extracting the best information at each iteration several families of numerical procedures which use the technique of the procedures in a parallel processing environment are developed and measurements of these statistics are reported these measurements are interpreted in a parallel processing environment in such an environment the procedures obtained are superior to standard algorithms cacm may 1967 shedler g s ca670505 jb february 28 1978 10:44 am
