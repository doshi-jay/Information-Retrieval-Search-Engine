an algorithm for generating permutations an algorithm is described which under repeated application generates all permutations of k elements only the previously generated permutation the constant k and a temporary index are needed starting with a particular ordering of k elements abcd repeated application of the algorithm will generate k-1 additional permutations by k-1 successive rotations from the initial circular ordering of k objects another circular ordering can be obtained by rotating the k-1 lowest elements for each new k-1 circular ordering another k-2 can be obtained by rotating the k-2 lowest elements by continuing in this manner applications of the algorithm will generate all k-1 circular orderings or since each circular ordering yields k permutations the algorithm generates all k permutations cacm may 1967 langdon jr g g ca670508 jb february 28 197810:35 am
