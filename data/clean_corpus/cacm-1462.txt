multilevel operating systems the basic software for all newer computers is built on the well-established need for standard operating systems this implies that all applications-no matter how large complex or time consuming-must operate under or more precisely on top of the standard system large applications require supervisory monitors which handle problems similar to those of the operating systems but at a different level sometimes still a third or even a fourth such level is required or desirable this leads naturally to the concept of multilevel systems-similar vertically but different horizontally proper division of responsibility between levels leads to greater efficiency and less logical complexity while actually enhancing capability cacm march 1966 orchard-hays w ca660310 jb march 3 1978 1:31 pm
