interference between communicating parallel processes various kinds of interference between communicating parallel processes have been examined by dijkstra knuth and others solutions have been given for the mutual exclusion problem and associated subproblems in the form of parallel programs and informal proofs of correctness have been given for these solutions in this paper a system of parallel processes is regarded as a machine which proceeds from one state s ie a collection of pertinent data values and process configurations to a next state s in accordance with a transition rule s  s a set of such rules yields sequences of states which dictate the systems behavior the mutual exclusion problem and the associated subproblems are formulated as questions of inclusion between sets of states or of the existence of certain sequences a mechanical proof procedure is shown which will either verify prove the correctness of  or discredit prove the incorrectness of an attempted solution with respect to any of the interference properties it is shown how to calculate transition rules from the partial rules by which the individual processes operate the formation of partial rules and the calculation of transition rules are both applicable to hardware processes as well as to software processes and symmetry between processes is not required cacm june 1972 gilbert p chandler w j concurrent programming control cooperating processes formal programs interference mutual exclusion operating systems parallel processes 4.0 4.10 4.30 4.32 4.42 5.24 6.20 ca720603 jb january 31 1978 8:44 am
