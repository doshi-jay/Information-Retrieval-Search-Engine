techniques for the simulation of computer logic the simulation of a digital computer is an integral part of most computer design automation systems the evaluation of the boolean functions which characterize the computer being simulated constitutes one major portion of a simulation system four general procedural classes for evaluating these functions are defined toward greatly increased efficiency of a simulation system methods are presented for simultaneously evaluating many functions for one set of values of the variablesand for evaluating simultaneously one function for many sets of values for the variables cacm july 1964 breuerm a ca640717 jb march 9 1978 7:42 pm
