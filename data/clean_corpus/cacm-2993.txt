occurrences of cycling and other phenomena arising in a class of linear programming models an investigation into the average queue size for a certain class of queues has resulted in the formulation of linear programming problems which are ill-conditioned in some cases in attempting to solve these linear programming models using ibms mps package instances of cycling were encountered small perturbations in the input data resulted in problems which did not cycle this fact plus several other observed phenomena suggest that the primary reason that cycling is not known to occur more frequently is the round-off errors in the computations perturb the problem sufficiently to prevent cycling or at least to prevent indefinite cycling in one case maximizing and minimizing an objective function subject to the same constrain t set was attempted but mps solved only one of these while giving an indication of infeasibility for the other cacm february 1977 kotiah t c t steinberg d i linear programming cycling queueing models 5.41 5.9 ca770208 jb december 30 1977 2:11 am
