a lattice model of secure information flow this paper investigates mechanisms that guarantee secure information flow in a computer system these mechanisms are examined within a mathematical framework suitable for formulating the requirements of secure information flow among security classes the central component of the model is a lattice structure derived from the security classes and justified by the semantics of information flow the lattice properties permit concise formulations of the security requirements of different existing systems and facilitate the construction of mechanisms that enforce security the model provides a unifying view of all systems that restrict information flow enables a classification of them according to security objectives and suggests some new approaches it also leads to the construction of automatic program certification mechanisms for verifying the secure flow of information through a program cacm may 1976 denning d e protection security information flow security class lattice program certification 4.35 ca760501 jb january 4 1978 4:10 pm
