the design of the venus operating system the venus operating system is an experimental multiprogramming system which supports five or six concurrent users on a small computer the system was produced to test the effect of machine architecture on complexity of software the system is defined by a combination of microprograms and software the microprogram defines a machine with some unusual architectural feature the software exploits these features to define the operating system as simply as possible in this paper the development of the system is described with particular emphasis on the principles which guided the design cacm march 1972 liskov b h operating systems system design levels of abstraction machine architecture microprogramming segments semaphores multiprogramming virtual machines processes process communication virtual devices data sharing resource management deadlock 4.30 4.32 4.41 6.21 ca720302 jb january 31 1978 3:16 pm
