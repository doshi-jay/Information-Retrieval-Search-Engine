computer generation of gamma random variates with non-integral shape parameters when the shape parameter a is integral generating gamma random variables with a digital computer is straightforward there is no simple method for generating gamma random variates with non-integral shape parameters a common procedure is to approximately generate such random variables by use of the so-called probability switch method another procedure which is exact is due to johnk this paper presents a rejection method for exactly generating gamma random variables when a is greater than 1 the efficiency of the rejection method is shown to be better than the efficiency of johnks method the paper concludes that when a is non-integral the following mix of procedures yields the best combination of accuracy and efficiency 1 when a is less than 1 use johnks method 2 when 1 is less than a and a is less than 5 use the rejection method 3 when a is greater than 5 use the probability switch method cacm december,1974 wallace n d simulation gamma random variables probability distribution random numbers 5.5 8.1 ca741205 jb january 16 1978 9:35 am
