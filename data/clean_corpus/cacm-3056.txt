counting large numbers of events in small registers it is possible to use a small counter to keep approximate counts of large numbers the resulting expected error can be rather precisely controlled an example is given in which 8-bit counters bytes are used to keep track of as many as 130,000 events with a relative error which is substantially independent of the number n of events this relative error can be expected to be 24 percent or less 95 percent of the time ieo  n/8 the techniques could be used to advantage in multichannel counting hardware or software used for the monitoring of experiments or processes cacm october 1978 morris r counting 5.11 ca781005 dh january 29 1979 5:52 pm
