impact of computers on the undergraduate mathematics curriculum the use of computers to permit the widespread application of mathematical ideas requiring computation in science and technology is extremely significant for the understanding of our current society student interest in this development is intense and if properly utilized should yield a much better understanding of mathematical concepts as well as the ideas of programming and logical structure which have been introduced into many fields by the use of computers the present paper suggests that that portion of the undergraduate mathematical curriculum which is preparation for the use of mathematics by persons who are not professional mathematicians be modified to include the extensions and clarifications which are possible because of computers an early introduction to programming is desirable to permit a continuing use of automatic computation to illustrate and clarify mathematical concepts following the calculus equation stage an intensive introduction to numerical analysis should be added to the current curriculum in addition to providing competence in the mostly used computing techniques it would permit a more sophisticated utilization of the advanced mathematical ideas associated with complex variables and transform theories cacm september 1966 murray f j ca660905 jb march 2 1978 6:31 pm
