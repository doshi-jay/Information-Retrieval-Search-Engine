a general method of systematic interval computation for numerical integration of initial value problems a procedure is given for continuously computing and monitoring the step size to be used by a self-starting p-th order numerical integration method to solve an initial value problem the procedure uses an estimate of the truncation error to calculate the step size cacm october 1966 martin w c paulson k c sashkin l ca661004 jb march 2 1978 4:05 pm
