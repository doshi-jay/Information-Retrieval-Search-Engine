practical error coefficients for estimating quadrature errors for analytic functions all published error coefficients for estimating quadrature errors for analytic functions were computed on the assumption that the quadrature rule was exact for polynomials up to a given degree since these rules use rounded values for the abscissas and weights and since the true values of the integrals of some of the polynomials in question have an infinite binary expression the quadrature rule is not exact hence these errors must be taken into consideration in computing practical error coefficients cacm january 1968 rabinowitz p numerical integration quadrature truncation error theoretical error coefficients practical error coefficients integration analytical functions roundoff error 5.11 5.16 ca680110 jb february 23 1978 2:22 pm
