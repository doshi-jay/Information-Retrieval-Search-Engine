optimal shift strategy for a block-transfer ccd memory for the purposes of this paper a block-transfer ccd memory is composed of serial shift registers whose shift rate can vary but which have a definite minimum shift rate the refresh rate and a definite maximum shift rate the bits iin the shift registers are numbered 0 to n  1 and blocks of n bits are always transferred always starting at bit 0 what is the best shift strategy so that a block transfer request occurring at a random time will have to wait the minimal amount of time before bit 0 can be reached the minimum shift rate requirement does not allow one to simply park at bit 0 and wait for a transfer request the optimal strategy involves shifting as slowly as possible until bit 0 is passed then shifting as quickly as possible until a critical boundary is reached shortly before bit 0 comes around again this is called the hurry up and wait strategy and is well known outside the computer field the block-transfer ccd memory can also be viewed as a paging drum with a variable bounded rotation speed cacm may,1978 sites r paging drum charge coupled devices shift register memory memory hierarchy electronic drum latency 3.72 5.39 6.34 6.35 ca780510 dh february 26 1979 1:05 pm
