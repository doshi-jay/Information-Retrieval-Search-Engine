test data as an aid in proving program correctness proofs of program correctness tend to be long and tedious whereas testing though useful in detecting errors usually does not guarantee correctness this paper introduces a techniques whereby test data can be used in proving program correctness in addition to simplifying the process of proving correctness this method simplifies the process of providing accurate specification for a program the applicability of this technique to procedures and recursive programs is demonstrated cacm may 1978 geller m program verification program testing recursive programs 4.22 4.6 5.24 ca780503 dh february 26 1979 2:10 pm
