on programming the numerical solution of polynomial equations numerical techniques are presented for computing the roots of polynomial equations by applying the recommended scaling and inversion rules the basic bairstow and newton-raphson iterative techniques can be applied with great reliability both a high degree of accuracy and rapid convergence are realized numerical examples are shown to illustrate the pitfalls and to show how these are circumvented by application of the recommended procedures cacm december 1960 ellenberger k w ca601205 jb march 20 1978 6:41 pm
