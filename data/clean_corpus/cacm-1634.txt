27 bits are not enough for 8-digit accuracy from the inequality 10^8  2^27 we are likely to conclude that we can represent 8-digit decimal floating-point numbers accurately by 27-bit floating-point numbers however we need 28 significant bits to represent some 8-digit numbers accurately in general we can show that if 10^p  2^q-1 then q significant bits are always enough for p-digit decimal accuracy finally we can define a compact 27-bit floating-point representation that will give 28 significant bits for numbers of practical importance cacm february 1967 goldberg i b ca670208 jb february 28 1978 2:38 pm
