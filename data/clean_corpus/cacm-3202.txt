manip a computer system for algebra and analytic differentiation a mathematical expression to be operated upon is written in fortran-like notation and stored in the computer as a string of bcd characters with all blanks removed it may be as complicated as desired parentheses nested without restriction etc so long as the entire expression or any subsequent form does not exceed 5000 characters the problemm of performing algebraic operations and obtaining analytic derivatives was translated into that of identifying and manipulating character sequences programs which resulted were written in fortran iv for a cdc 3600 and are discussed in detail cacm august 1966 bender b ca660816 es march 17 1982 10:10 am
