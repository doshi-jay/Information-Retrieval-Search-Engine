description of basic algorithm in detab/65 preprocessor the basic algorithm for the conversion of decision tables into cobol code is contained in the generator portion of the detab/65 preprocessor the generator analyzes a decision table and produces simple cobol conditional statements core storage is saved by using queueing techniques and extensive indexing and also by outputting the code as it is generated a line at a time the only optimization attempted is the elimination of obviously unnecessary tests on certain conditions in the decision table since the preprocessor and this language associated with it were developed for cobol users the preprocessor was written in a modular form in required cobol-61 cacm july 1967 callahan m d chapman a e ca670709 jb february 28 1978 8:33 am
