on computing the fast fourier transform cooley and tukey have proposed a fast algorithm for computing complex fourier transform and have shown major time savings in using it to compute large transforms on a digital computer with n a power of two computing time for this algorithm is proportional to n log2 n a major improvement over other methods with computing time proportional to n^2 in this paper the fast fourier transform algorithm is briefly reviewed and fast difference equation methods for accurately computing the needed trigonometric function values are given the problem of computing a large fourier transform on a system with virtual memory is considered and a solution is proposed this method has been used to compute complex fourier transforms of size n  2^16 on a computer with 2^15 words of core storage this exceeds by a factor of eight the maximum radix two transform size with fixed allocation of this amount of core storage the method has also been used to compute large mixed radix transforms a scaling plan for computing the fast fourier transform with fixed-point arithmetic is also given cacm october 1967 singleton r c ca671008 jb february 27 1978 2:03 pm
