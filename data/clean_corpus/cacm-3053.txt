packed scatter tables scatter tables for open addressing benefit from recursive entry displacements cutoffs for unsuccessful searches and auxiliary cost functions compared with conventional methods the new techniques provide substantially improved tables that resemble exact-solution optimal packings the displacements are depth-limited approximations to an enumerative exhaustive optimization although packing costs remain linear-on-with table size n the techniques are primarily suited for important fixed but possibly quite large tables for which reference frequencies may be known op-code tablesspelling dictionaries access arrays introduction of frequency weights further improves retrievals but the enhancement may degrade cutoffs cacm october 1978 lyon g assignment problem backtrack programming hashing open addressing recursion scatter table rearrangements 3.74 4.0 ca781008 dh january 29 1979 5:30 pm
