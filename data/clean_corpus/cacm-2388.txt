optimizing binary trees grown with a sorting algorithm items can be retrieved from binary trees grown with a form of the algorithm quicksort in an average time proportional to log n where n is the number of items in the tree the binary trees grown by this algorithm sometimes have some branches longer than others therefore it is possible to reduce the average retrieval time by restructuring the tree to make the branches as uniform in length as possible an algorithm to do this is presented the use of this algorithm is discussed and it is compared with another which restructures the tree after each new item is added cacm february 1972 martin w a ness d n retrieving information from binary trees global and local optimization sorting recursion 3.74 5.31 ca720203 jb january 31 1978 4:30 pm
