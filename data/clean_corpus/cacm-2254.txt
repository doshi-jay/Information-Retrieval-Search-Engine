dynamic partitioning for array languages the classical process of partitioning an array into subarrays is extended to a more useful array language operation various modes of partitioning are defined for different types of arrays so that subarrays may vary over the original array in a nearly arbitrary manner these definitions are motivated with several realistic examples to illustrate the value of partitioning for array languages of general interest is the data structure for partitioning this consists of dynamic tree structures which are used to derive and maintain the array control information these are described in sufficient detail to be of value in the design of other array languages the description presented in this paper is implemented in a new array language ol/2 currently under development at the university of illinois cacm december 1972 phillips j r adams h c dynamic partitioning array partitioning array language data structure tree structure programming language design array control blocks partition control blocks 4.12 4.2 4.22 ca721201 jb january 27 1978 1:20 pm
