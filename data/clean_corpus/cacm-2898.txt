a conceptual framework for a nonprocedural programming language a sequential programming language forces the programmer to prescribe explicitly the order in which the operations in his program have to be executed even if the order is not relevant to the solution of his problem the requirement to indicate irrelevant sequencing can be removed if the language provides facilities for specifying a task in a nonprocedural manner in general a program specified in this way will allow concurrent evaluation this paper describes a conceptual framework for a high level programming language providing both nonprocedural and sequential facilities within a program nonprocedural and sequential program modules may be nested freely cacm december 1977 kessels j l w parallel programming descriptive programming nonprocedural programming definitional language data flow programming applicative programming 4.20 ca771202 jb february 1 1980 4:05 am
