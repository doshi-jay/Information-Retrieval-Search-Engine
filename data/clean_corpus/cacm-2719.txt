mechanical program analysis one means of analyzing program performance is by deriving closed-form expressions for their execution behavior this paper discusses the mechanization of such analysis and describes a system metric which is able to analyze simple lisp programs and produce for example closed-form expressions for their running time expressed in terms of size of input this paper presents the reasons for mechanizing program analysis describes the operation of metric explains its implementation and discusses its limitations cacm september 1975 wegbreit b analysis of programs performance analysis execution time execution behavior difference equations generating functions list processing lisp algebraic manipulation programming languages analysis of algorithms 3.69 4.22 5.24 5.25 ca750905 jb january 6 1978 2:11 pm
