the cray-1 computer system this paper describes the cray-1 discusses the evolution of its architecture and gives an account of some of the problems that were overcome during its manufacture the cray-1 is the only computer to have been built to date that satisfies erdas class vi requirement a computer capable of processing from 20 to 60 million floating point operations per second 1 the cray-1s fortran compiler cft is designed to give the scientific user immediate access to the benefits of the cray-1s vector processing architecture an optimizing compiler cft vectorizes innermost do loops compatible with the ansi 1966 fortran standard and with many commonly supported fortran extensions cft does not require any source program modifications or the use of additional nonstandard fortran statements to achieve vectorization thus the users investment of hundreds of man months of effort to develop fortran programs for other contemporary computers is protected cacm january 1978 russell r architecture computer systems 1.2 6.2 6.3 ca780106 jb march 28 1978 5:24 pm
