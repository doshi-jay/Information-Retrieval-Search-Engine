design of a separable transition-diagram compiler a cobol compiler design is presented which is compact enough to permit rapid one-pass compilation of a large subset of cobol on a moderately large computer versions of the same compiler for smaller machines require only two working tapes plus a compiler tape the methods given are largely applicable to the construction of algol compilers cacm july 1963 conway m e ca630725 jb march 14 1978 8:11 am
