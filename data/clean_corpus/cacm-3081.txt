shallow binding in lisp 1.5 shallow binding is a scheme which allows the value of a variable to be accessed in a bounded amount of computation an elegant model for shallow binding in lisp 1.5 is presented in which context-switching is an environment tree transformation called rerooting rerooting is completely general and reversible and is optional in the sense that a lisp 1.5 interpreter will operate correctly whether or not rerooting is invoked one very context change since rerooting leaves assoc v a invariant for all variables v and all environments a the programmer can have access to a rerooting primitive shallow which gives him dynamic control over whether accesses are shallow or deep and which affects only the speed of execution of a program not its semantics in addition multiple processes can be active in the same environment structure so long as rerooting is an indivisible operation finally the concept of rerooting is shown to combine the concept of shallow binding in lisp with dijkstras display for algol and hence is a general model for shallow binding cacm july 1978 baker h jr lisp 1.5 environment trees funargs shallow binding deep binding multiprogramming algol display 4.13 4.22 4.32 ca780707 dh february 7 1979 4:14 pm
