an axiomatic basis for computer programming in this paper an attempt is made to explore the logical foundations of computer programming by use of techniques which were first applied in the study of geometry and have later been extended to other branches of mathematics this involves the elucidation of sets of axioms and rules of inference which can be used in proofs of the properties of computer programs examples are given of such axioms and rules and a formal proof of a simple theorem is displayed finally it is argued that important advantages both theoretical and practical may follow from a pursuance of these topics cacm october 1969 hoare c a r axiomatic method theory of programming proofs of programs formal language definition programming language design machine-independent programming program documentation 4.0 4.21 4.22 5.20 5.21 5.23 5.24 ca691012 jb february 15 1978 1:48 pm
