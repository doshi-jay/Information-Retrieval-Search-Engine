eigenvectors of a 2n x 2n matrix it has been known that the eigenvalues of a certain 2n x 2n matrix can be obtained by use of two smaller matrices of order n which can be easily constructed an algorithm is given to obtain the eigenvectors of the 2n x 2n matrix by use of the eigenvectors of the smaller matrices cacm december 1967 charmonman s ca671207 jb february 26 1978 2:22 pm
