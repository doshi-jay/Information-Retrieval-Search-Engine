an analysis of some time-sharing techniques the effectiveness of certain time-sharing techniques such as program relocation disk rotational delay minimization and swap volume minimization is investigated summary data is presented and the findings are discussed the vehicle for this investigation was a simula based simulation model reflecting an early framework for a planned burroughs b6500 time-sharing system inasmuch as the b6500 system is based upon the use of variable sized segments and a dynamic overlay procedure data is also presented which provides some indication of the effectiveness of this type of organization in a time-sharing environment the design characteristics and operational capabilities of the simulation model are also described cacm february 1971 nielsen n r b6500 bulk core usage operating system model relocation rotational delay minimization simulation swap volume minimization system simulation time-sharing 3.9 4.32 ca710203 jb february 8 1978 9:40 am
