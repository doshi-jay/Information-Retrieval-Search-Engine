structured multiprogramming this paper presents a proposal for structured representation of multiprogramming in a high level language the notation used explicitly associates a data structure shared by concurrent processes with operations defined on it this clarifies the meaning of programs and permits a large class of time-dependent errors to be caught at compile time a combination of critical regions and event variables enables the programmer to control scheduling of resources among competing processes to any degree desired these concepts are sufficiently safe to use not only within operating systems but also within user programs cacm july 1972 hansen p b structured multiprogramming programming languages operating systems concurrent processes shared data mutual exclusion critical regions process communication synchronizing events 4.2 4.3 ca720708 jb january 30 1978 2:39 pm
