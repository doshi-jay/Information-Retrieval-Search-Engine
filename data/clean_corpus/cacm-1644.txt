on the computation of least squares polynomials rounding error accumulated during digital computation of a least squares polynomial makes the computed polynomial only an approximation to the true least square polynomial a simple method for adjust ing the constant term of the computed polynomial to get a better approximation to the true least squares polynomial is described cacm january 1967 goldberg m ca670111 jb february 28 1978 4:24 pm
