least squares fitting of planes to surfaces using dynamic programming dynamic programming has recently been used by stone by bellman and by gluss to determine the closet fit of broken line segments to a curve in an interval under the constraint that the number of segments is fixed in the present paper successive models are developed to extend the method to the fitting of broken plane segments to surfaces zgxy defined over certain types of subareas of the xy-space the first model considers a rectangular area with the constraint that the plane segments are defined over a grid in the xy-space it is then shown how this model may be incorporated into an algorithm that provides successive approximations to optimal fits for any type of closed area finally applications are briefly described cacm april 1963 gluss b ca630424 jb march 14 1978 11:43 am
