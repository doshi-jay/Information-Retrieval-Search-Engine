syntactic analysis by digital computer this paper provides an account of the shadow language that is used to describe syntax and of a corresponding subroutine that enables a computer to perform syntactic analysis the input to this subroutine consists of a string to be analyzed and a description of the syntax that is to be used the syntax is expressed in the shadow language the output consists of a trace table that expresses the results of the syntactic analysis in a tabular form several versions of the subroutine and some associated programs have been in use now for over three years the present account of the language and the subroutine contains a summary of material that has been described previously in unpublished reports and also some additional discussion of the work in relation to the more general questions of problem-oriented languages and string transformations cacm october 1962 barnett m p futrelle r p ca621016 jb march 17 1978 7:11 pm
