a selective traversal algorithm for binary search trees the problem of selecting data items from a binary search tree according to a list of range conditions is considered the process of visiting a minimal number of nodes to retrieve data satisfying the range conditions is called selective traversal presented in this paper is an algorithm for selective traversal which uses a tag field for each node in the tree the algorithm is particularly useful and efficient when examination of data is more time consuming than examination of a tag field cacm june 1978 driscoll j lien y data retrieval range conditions binary search tree tree traversal selective traversal 3.74 5.24 5.25 ca780602 dh february 26 1979 12:40 pm
