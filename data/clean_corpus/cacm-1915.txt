an algorithm for hidden line elimination the algorithm presented causes the elimination of hidden lines in the representation of a perspective view of concave and convex plane-faced objects on the picture plane all the edges of the objects are considered sequentially and all planes which hide every point of an edge are found the computing time increases roughly as the square of the number of edges the algorithm takes advantage of a reduced number of concave points and automatically recognizes if only one object with no concave points is considered in this last case the result is obtained in a much simpler way cacm april 1969 galimberti r montanari u hidden line elimination back line recognition three-dimensional representation plane-faced objects perspective view machine rendering of solids automatic drawing displaying techniques computer graphics man/machine interaction man/machine communication computer-aided design 4.40 4.41 4.49 ca690402 jb february 17 1978 4:44 pm
