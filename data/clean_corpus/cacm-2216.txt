on the probability distribution of the values of binary trees an integral equation is derived for the generating function for binary tree values the values reflecting sorting effort the analysis does not assume uniformly distributed branching ratios and therefore is applicable to a family of sorting algorithms discussed by hoare singleton and van emden the solution to the integral equation indicates that using more advanced algorithms in the family makes only minor reductions in the expected sorting effort but substantially reduces the variance in sorting effort statistical tests of the values of several thousand trees containing up to 10,000 points have given first second and third moments of the value distribution function in satisfactory agreement with the moments computed from the generating function the empirical tests as well as the analytical results are in agreement with previously published results for the first moment in the cases of uniform and nonuniform distribution of branching ratio and for the second moment in the case of uniform distribution of branching ratio cacm february 1971 hurwitz jr h binary trees sorting statistical analysis 4.40 5.18 5.5 ca710205 jb february 8 1978 9:09 am
