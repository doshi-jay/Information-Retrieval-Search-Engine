manipulation of algebraic expressions an algorithm for algebraically manipulating expressions of the form sumcipi i1n has been developed in conjunction with the development of programs for systems analysis problems this algorithm enablesus to derive over-all system transfer functions from algebraically described block diagrams of any linear continuous multi-loop feedback system the machine representation of the derived expression is by virtue of the algorithm in a form which simplifies the task of compiling the algorithm was developed for a particular purpose in connection with system analysis studies however its application as a mathematical device extends far beyond the confines of the original problem cacm september 1961 rom a r m ca610910 jb march 16 1978 9:36 pm
