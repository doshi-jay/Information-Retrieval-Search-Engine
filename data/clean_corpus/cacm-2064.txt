operations on generalized arrays with the genie compiler operations on vectors matrices and higher dimensional storage arrays are standard features of most compilers today the elements of such structures are usually restricted to be scalars for many sophisticated applications this restriction can impose cumbersome data representations an efficient system has been devised and implemented which allows the elements of multidimensional arrays to themselves be multidimensional arrays this system was developed from a storage structure in which the location length and content of each array is described by a codeword which can be interpreted by the system code words may describe arrays containing more codewords thus providing all needed descriptive information for hyperstructures of any form cacm may 1970 sitton g a multidimensional arrays matrix operations storage control subscripting compilers 4.12 4.29 ca700502 jb february 13 1978 2:18 pm
