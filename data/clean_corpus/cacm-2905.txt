perfect hashing functions a single probe retrieving method for static sets a refinement of hashing which allows retrieval of an item in a static table with a single probe is considered given a set i of identifiers two methods are presented for building in a mechanical way perfect hashing functions ie functions transforming the elements of i into unique addresses the first method the quotient reduction method is shown to be complete in the sense that for every set i the smallest table in which the elements of i can be stored and from which they can be retrieved by using a perfect hashing function constructed by this method can be found however for nonuniformly distributed sets this method can give rather sparse tables the second method the remainder reduction method is not complete in the above sense but it seems to give minimal or almost minimal tables for every kind of set the two techniques are applicable directly to small sets some methods to extend these results to larger sets are also presented a rough comparison with ordinary hashing is given which shows that this method can be used conveniently in several practical applications cacm november 1977 sprugnoli r hashing hashing methods hash coding direct addressing identifier-to-address transformations perfect hashing functions perfect hash coding reduction scatter storage 3.7 3.74 4.34 ca771111 jb december 27 1977 6:45 am
