a use of macros in translation of symbolic assembly language of one computer to another a set of macro-operations has been prepared to assist in translating ibm 7090 symbolic assembly language programs to ibm 7040 machine language programs this set inserted at the beginning of the 7090 symbolic deck treats incompatible instruction mnemonics as macro-instructions to produce equivalent 7040 instruction sets incompatible instructions are categorized into basic operational classes which can be expressed by a single basic skeleton several levels of macro calls are required to supply arguments to the basic skeleton for each particular instruction modification at execution time of the address or tag of an incompatible instruction requires incorporation of an address-tag equivalent i/o is handled by generating calls to i/o simulation subroutines cacm december 1965 dellert jr g t ca651203 jb march 6 1978 4:20 pm
