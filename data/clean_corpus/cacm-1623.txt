an application of formac a nonlinear circuit analysis problem is stated and the way in which it was solved using formac is indicated the solution of the problem using formac was notable since several other methods that were tried failed the problem is straightforward although untenable by hand but nevertheless involved an elaborate use of the formac language the program was fairly large and utilized practically every command in particular it made extensive use of the part command several tricks were necessary in order to circumvent some of the shortcomings of the formac system this paper is more concerned with the use of programming techniques in formac than with the actual engineering problem although readers may be interested in the problem because it is stated in a general mathematical sense and could be of interest in areas other than circuit analysis cacm march 1967 neidleman l d ca670306 jb february 28 1978 1:27 pm
