designing surfaces in 3-d an experimental system for computer-aided design of free-form surfaces in three dimensions is described the surfaces are represented in the system as parametric basis splines the principal features of the system are 1 the surfaces are rendered as isoparametric line drawings on a head-mounted display and they are designed with the aid of a three-dimensional wand which allows 3-d movements of the points controlling the shapes of the surfaces 2 all of the interactions with the surfaces are in real-time and 3 the mathematical formulations used assume no knowledge of them by the user of the system also examined are some of the features that should be part of a practical 3-d system for designing space-forms cacm august 1976 clark j h real-time graphics computer-aided design picture processing b-splines 3-d displays 3.80 6.22 8.2 ca760803 jb january 4 1978 10:25 am
