models for parallel processing within programs application to cpu:i/o and i/o:i/o overlap approximate queueing models for internal parallel processing by individual programs in a multiprogrammed system are developed in this paper the solution technique is developed by network decomposition the models are formulated in terms of cpu:i/o and i/o:i/o overlap and applied to the analysis of these problems the percentage performance improvement from cpu:i/o overlap is found to be greatest for systems which are in approximate cpu:i/o utilization balance and for low degrees of multiprogramming the percentage improvement from i/o:i/o overlap is found to be greatest for systemtems in which the i/o system is more utilized than the cpu cacm october 1978 towsley d chandy k browne j multiprogramming parallel processing queueing network models multiprocessing of computation and i/o 4.32 8.1 ca781002 dh january 29 1979 6:23 pm
