on the downhill method the downhill method is a numerical method for solving complex equations fz  0 on which the only restriction is that the function w  fz must be analytical an introduction to this method is given and a critical review of relating literature is presented although in theory the method always converges it is shown that a fundamental dilemma exists which may cause a breakdown in practical applications to avoid this difficulty and to improve the rate of convergence toward a root some modifications of the original method are proposed and a program fortran based on the modified method is given in algorithm 365 some numerical examples are included cacm december 1969 bach h downhill method complex relaxation method complex iteration complex equation transcendental complex equation algebraic complex equation 5.15 ca691206 jb february 15 1978 2:54 pm
