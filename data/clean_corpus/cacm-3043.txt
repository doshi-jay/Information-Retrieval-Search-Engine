distributed processes a concurrent programming concept a language concept for concurrent processes without common variables is introduced these processes communicate and synchronize by means of procedure calls and guarded regions this concept is proposed for real-time applications controlled by microcomputer networks with distributed storage the paper gives several examples of distributed processes and shows that they include procedures coroutines classes monitors processes semaphores buffers path expressions and input/output as special cases cacm november 1978 hansen p concurrent programming distributed processes microprocessor networks nondeterminism guarded regions programming languages process communication and scheduling sorting arrays coroutines classes monitors processes semaphores buffers path expressions input/output 3.8 4.2 4.22 4.32 5.24 ca781108 dh january 26 1979 10:40 am
