simulation of traffic flows in a network a computer simulation program which deals with traffic flows in the network of a large area is described each road is segmented into blocks of several ten-meter lengths and is represented by a bidirectional list in computer memory the movement of cars ie the transfer of cars from one block to the next is expressed by a proper formula this formula is based on the supposition that the speed of cars in a block is determined only by the density of cars in the block and this speed-versus-density curve is empirically given the numerical values this simulation scheme has its excellent point in that it makes it possible to trace the dynamic behavior of traffic flows in a variety of situations some examples of which are given for an actual area of the city of kyoto japan june 1969 sakai t nagao m traffic simulation traffic flow traffic network traffic control traffic density intersection signal setting vehicle road network list structure computer simulation 3.57 3.23 ca690603 jb february 17 1978 1:26 pm
