horners rule for the evaluation of general closed queueing networks the solution of separable closed queueing networks requires the evaluation of homogeneous multinomial expressions the number of terms in those expressions grows combinatorially with the size of the network such that a direct summation may become impractical an algorithm is given which does not show a combinatorial operation count the algorithm is based on a generalization of horners rule for polynomials it is also shown how mean queue size and throughput an be obtained at negligible extra cost once the normalization constant is evaluated cacm october 1975 reiser m kobayashi h queueing networks queueing theory horners rule evaluation of multinomial sums load-dependent service rate 5.12 5.5 8.1 8.3 ca751007 jb january 6 1978 10:35 am
