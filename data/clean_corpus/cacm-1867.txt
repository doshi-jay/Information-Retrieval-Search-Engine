on the expected lengths of sequences generated in sorting by replacement selecting in the replacement-selecting technique of sorting one is interested in the ratio lj of the expected length of the j-th sequence generated by the technique to the number of memory cells used using complex-variable theory it is shown that lj  2 and that asymptotically the average interval between sign changes of lj-2 is 2.6662 cacm july 1969 hooker w w replacement selecting sorting sequence lengths asymptotic expected length recursion relation generating function meromorphic function 3.74 5.31 ca690713 jb february 15 1978 6:37 pm
