median split trees a fast lookup technique for frequently occuring keys split trees are a new technique for searching sets of keys with highly skewed frequency distributions a split tree is a binary search tree each node of which contains two key values-a node value which is a maximally frequent key in that subtree and a split value which partitions the remaining keys with respect to their lexical ordering between the left and right subtrees a median split tree mst uses the lexical median of a nodes descendents as its split value to force the search tree to be perfectly balanced achieving both a space efficient representation of the tree and high search speed unlike frequency ordered binary search trees the cost of a successful search of an mst is log n bounded and very stable around minimal values further an mst can be built for a given key ordering and set of frequencies in time n log n as opposed to n2 for an optimum binary search tree a discussion of the application of msts to dictionary lookup for english is presented and the performance obtained is contrasted with that of other techniques cacm november 1978 sheil b tree search dictionary lookup binary search heaps balanced trees zipfs law information retrieval 3.74 5.25 5.39 ca781110 dh january 25 1979 9:49 am
