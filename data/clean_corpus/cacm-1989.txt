transition network grammars for natural language analysis the use of augmented transition network grammars for the analysis of natural language sentences is described structure-building actions associated with the arcs of the grammar network allow for the reordering restructuring and copying of constituents necessary to produce deep-structure representations of the type normally obtained from a transformational analysis and conditions on the arcs allow for a powerful selectivity which can rule out meaningless analyses and take advantage of semantic information to guide the parsing the advantage of this model for natural language analysis are discussed in detail and illustrated by examples an implementation of an experimental parsing system for transition network grammars is briefly described cacm october 1970 woods w a computational linguistics grammars grammar models linguistics natural language analysis parsing semantic interpretation transition network grammars transformational grammars 3.42 4.12 ca701001 jb february 10 1978 9:43 am
