cubic spline solutions to fourth-order boundary value problems the cubic spline approximation to the fourth-order differential equation y+pxy+qxy+rxytx is shown to reduce to the solution of a five-term recurrence relationship for some special cases the approximation is shown to be simply related to a finite difference representation with a local truncation error of order y/720delta^8 cacm june 1973 hoskins w d cubic spline differential equations boundary value problem 5.13 5.17 ca730613 jb january 23 1978 1:44 pm
