an analysis of algorithms for the dutch national flag problem solutions to the dutch national flag problem have been given by dijkstra 1 and meyer 3 dijkstra starts with a simple program and arrives at an improved program by refinement both of the algorithms given by dijkstra are shown to have an expected number of swaps which is 2/3n + 01 and that these values differ at most by 1/3 of a swap and asymptotically by 1/4 of a swap the algorithm of meyer is shown to have expected swap complexity 5/9n cacm october 1978 mcmaster c algorithmic analysis dutch national flag problem refinement structured programming 4.0 5.24 5.25 5.3 ca781006 dh january 29 1979 5:47 pm
