a multiple-precision division algorithm a generalized division algorithm for use with positive integral operands is presented depending upon the algebraic relationship of the first two ciphers of the divisor one or at most two adjustments to the original divisor and dividend must be performed before the division operation can be initiated the uniqueness of this method will cause each trial cipher in the quotient to be either equal to or one greater than its final replacement cacm november 1970 mifsud c j multiple-precision division adjustment generalize 3.15 4.0 5.1 ca701103 jb february 10 1978 8:45 am
