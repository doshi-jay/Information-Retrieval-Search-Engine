storing a sparse table the problem of storing and searching large sparse tables is ubiquitous in computer science the standard technique for storing such tables is hashing but hashing has poor worst-case performance we propose a good worst-case method for storing a static table of n entries each an integer between 0 and n  1 the method requires 0n w words of storage and allows ologn n access time although our method is a little complicated to use in practice our analysis shows why a simpler algorithm used for compressing lr parsing tables works so well cacm november 1979 tarjan r yao a gaussian elimination parsing searching sparse matrix table compression table lookup 3.74 4.12 4.34 5.25 ca791104 db january 23 1980 11:24 am
