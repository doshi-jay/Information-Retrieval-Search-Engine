pdel-a language for partial differential equations conventional computer methods available to solve continuous system problems characterized by partial differential equations are very time-consuming and cumbersome a convenient easy to learn and to use high level problem oriented language to solve and study partial differential equation problems has been designed a practical translator for the language has also been designed and a working version of it has been constructed for a significant portion of the language this partial differential equation language pdel is outlined and the highlights of the translator are briefly summarized cacm march 1970 cardenas a f karplus w j problem oriented or digital simulation language partial differential equations translator pl/1 preprocessor pl/1 finite difference algorithms 3.1 3.2 4.22 5.17 ca700307 jb february 13 1978 4:18 pm
