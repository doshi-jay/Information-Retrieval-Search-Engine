the self-judgment method of curve fitting a computer-oriented method for processing and communicating numerical data is described the instrument reliability factors irf which exactly define the limits of reliability of each measured item of information are used to compute the maximum permitted error mpe associated with each values of each ordinate the self-judgment principle sjp is used to discard wrong information and to compute mean values of the parameters and their mpes in terms of the irf data compatibility tests with any number of different equations can be made quickly otherwise intractable problems are easily solved and the design of many experiments is greatly simplified the computational and mathematical techniques used to reduce bias in the sjp are discussed inadequacies in the statistical and graphical methods of curve fitting are noted cacm august 1965 demaine p a d ca650818 jb march 6 1978 7:50 pm
