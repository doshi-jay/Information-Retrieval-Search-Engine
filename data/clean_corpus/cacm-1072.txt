an improved equivalence algorithm an algorithm for assigning storage on the basis of equivalence dimension and common declarations is presented the algorithm is based on a tree structure and has reduced computation time by 40 percent over a previously published algorithm by identifying all equivalence classes with one scan of the equivalence declarations the method is applicable in any problem in which it is necessary to identify equivalence classes given the element pairs defining the equivalence relation cacm may 1964 galler b a fisher m j ca640517 jb march 9 1978 11:48 pm
