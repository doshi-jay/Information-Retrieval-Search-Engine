grad assistant  a program for symbolic algebraic manipulation and differentiation the general recursive algebra and differentiation assistant grad assistant now under development is a set of lisp functions which symbolically manipulate abd differentiate algebraic expressions it is designed for use with problemms in which a large amount of routine manipulation is to be done by a program without human intervention thus grad must recognize necessary simplifications without external guidance while some complicated expressions notably ones involving nested radicals and trigonometric functions do not yield completely to the present version it has proved quite useful indeed cacm august 1966 fletcher j g ca660817 es march 17 1982 10:10 am
