reduction a method of proving properties of parallel programs when proving that a parallel program has a given property it is often convenient to assume that a statement is indivisible ie that the statement cannot be interleaved with the rest of the program here sufficient conditions are obtained to show that the assumption that a statement is indivisible can be relaxed and still preserve properties such as halting thus correctness proofs of a parallel system can often be greatly simplified cacm december 1975 lipton r j deadlock free reduction interruptible indivisible parallel program semaphore verification method process computation sequence 4.32 4.35 5.24 ca751207 jb january 5 1978 3:59 pm
