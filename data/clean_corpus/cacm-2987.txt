representation of many-sided polygons and polygonal lines for rapid processing a representation for polygons and polygonal lines is described which allows sets of consecutive sides to be collectively examined the set of sides are arranged in a binary tree hierarchy by inclusion a fast algorithm for testing the inclusion of a poin t in a many-sided polygon is given the speed of the algorithm is discussed for both ideal and practical examples it is shown that the poin ts of intersection of two polygonal lines can be located by what is essentially a binary tree search the algorithm and a practical example are discussed the representation overcomes many of the disadvantages associated with the various fixed-grid methods for representing curves and regions cacm march 1977 burton w boundary line representation cartography computer graphics computer-searchable structures contour representation geographic information processing graphic data retrieval in tersection of curves line-drawing processing poin ts in polygons regional boundary representation spatial information 3.14 3.23 3.30 3.79 8.2 ca770305 jb december 30 1977 12:44 am
