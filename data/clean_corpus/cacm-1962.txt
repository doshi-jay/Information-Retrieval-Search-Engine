groove-a program to compose store and edit functions of time a program which makes possible creating storing reproducing and editing functions of time is described the functions are typical of those generated by human beings multiple functions up to 14 are produced for long periods of time up to several hours at sufficiently high sampling rates to describe fast human reactions up to 200 samples per second the functions can be used for a variety of purposes such as the control of machine tools or sound synthesizers or anything a person normally controls the program operates on a small computer ddp-224 functions are stored on a disk file functions may be created by real-time human inputs to the computer which can interact with already stored functions and computed functions real-time feedback from the process being controlled is an important link in the system the environment for effective man-machine interaction has been carefully nurtured cacm december 1970 mathews m v moore f r computer music music real-time control digital control time functions interactive software hybrid systems conductor program 3.44 3.8 7.3 ca701201 jb february 9 1978 4:19 pm
