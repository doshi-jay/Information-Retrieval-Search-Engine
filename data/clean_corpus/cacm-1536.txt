dynamic computation of derivatives it is shown how wengerts procedure for computation of derivatives can be implemented conveniently by use of compiler-generated complex addition subtraction and linkage to complex arithmetic subroutines evaluation of a function and derivative proceed in parallel as in wengerts procedure but with the imaginary parts of variables declared complex bearing the values of the derivatives of the real parts this technique provides a simple way to compute the derivatives of a function without the need for deriving and programming the evaluation of explicit formulas for the derivatives cacm september 1967 lesk a m ca670908 jb february 27 1978 3:11 pm
