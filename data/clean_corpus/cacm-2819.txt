experiments in text file compression a system for the compression of data files viewed as strings of characters is presented the method is general and applies equally well to english to pl/i or to digital data the system consists of an encoder an analysis program and a decoder two algorithms for encoding a string differ slightly from earlier proposals the analysis program attempts to find an optimal set of codes for representing substrings of the file four new algorithms for this operation are described and compared various parameters in the algorithms are optimized to obtain a high degree of compression for sample texts cacm november 1976 rubin f text compression data file compaction huffman codes n-gram encoding comparison of algorithms 3.7 3.73 4.33 ca761104 jb january 3 1978 3:26 pm
