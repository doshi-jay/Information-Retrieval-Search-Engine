simple lrk grammars a class of context-free grammars called the simple lrk or slrk grammars is defined this class has been shown to include weak precedence and simple precedence grammars as proper subsets how to construct parsers for the slrk grammars is also shown these parser-construction techniques are extendible to cover all of the lrk grammars of knuth they have been implemented and by direct comparison proved to be superior to precedence techniques not only in the range of grammars covered but also in the speed of parser construction and in the size and speed of the resulting parsers cacm july 1971 deremer f l context-free grammar lrk grammar precedence grammar syntactic analysis parsing algorithm parser finite-state machine deterministic pushdown automaton 4.12 5.22 5.23 ca710703 jb february 3 1978 9:31 am
