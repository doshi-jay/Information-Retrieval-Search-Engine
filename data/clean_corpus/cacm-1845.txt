loader standardization for overlay programs the overlay capability is described for four of the third generation computer systems cdc-6000 ge-635 ibm-360 and univac-1108 a critique of the first three systems is based on actual experience with a large overlaid trajectory simulation program a short history and description of this program is presented a standardization of minimum capabilities for loaders is recommended so that programs which must operate under more than one computer system may be easily converted and maintained a proposal that overlay software incorporates a memory occupation specification concept instead of the conditional tree structure is delineated this concept provides more efficient and cost-effective utilization of the memory as well as increased flexibility in program structure cacm october 1969 lanzano b c loader overlay partition region segmentation linkage linkage editor standardization memory utilization memory occupation tree structure cdc-6000 ge-635 ibm-360 univac-1108 4.10 4.12 4.19 4.40 ca691001 jb february 15 1978 4:09 pm
