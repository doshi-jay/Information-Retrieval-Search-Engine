implementing clenshaw-curtis quadrature i methodology and experience clenshaw-curtis quadrature is a particularly important automatic quadrature scheme for a variety of reasons especially the high accuracy obtained from relatively few integrand values however it has received little use because it requires the computation of a cosine transformation and the arithmetic cost of this has been prohibitive this paper is in two parts a companion paper ii computing the cosine transformation shows that this objection can be overcome by computing the cosine transformation by a modification of the fast fourier transform algorithm this first part discusses the strategy and various error estimates and summarizes experience with a particular implementation of the scheme cacm may 1972 gentleman w m clenshaw curtis numerical integration automatic quadrature error estimates chebyshev series 5.16 ca720505 jb january 31 1978 10:05 am
