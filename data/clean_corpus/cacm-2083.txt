creation and control of internal data bases under a fortran programming environment a method is described for the definition of a users common structure and the automatic generation of the necessary common dimension equivalence and type declarations for each of the users routines the definition for the common is contained in an easy to modify form thus allowing the control of general communications of data between routines the described system has been implemented on the ibm 7094 cdc 6000 series and the ibm 360 the method has proved to be invaluable for the definition and control of common in many large-scale programs cacm april 1970 desalvio a j purdy j g rau j data base fortran common common equivalencing subroutine communication data communication 3.73 4.12 4.43 ca700401 jb february 13 1978 3:34 pm
