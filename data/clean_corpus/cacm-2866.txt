proving monitors interesting scheduling and sequential properties of monitors can be proved by using state variables which record the monitors history and by defining extended proof rules for their wait and signal operations these two techniques are defined discussed and applied to examples to prove properties such as freedom from indefinitely repeated overtaking or unnecessary waiting upper bounds on queue lengths and historical behavior cacm may 1976 howard j monitors correctness proof rules historical variables concurrency scheduling bounded buffer semaphores alarm clock disk head 4.32 4.35 5.24 ca760505 jb january 4 1978 3:28 pm
