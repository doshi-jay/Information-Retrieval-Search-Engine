simulation of radioisotope scans by computer in radioisotope scanning a field which is assuming increasing importance in medical diagnosis the scan is a two-dimensional pattern made up of dots areas of increased source activity are represented on the scan by areas of increased dot density to study the output of scanners with various characteristics a program which simulates radioisotope scans has been written for a pdp-1 computer with auxiliary disk storage and cathode ray tube display past and present research using the output of the simulator has shown the flexibility of the system to be important the structure of this program can be useful in the simulation of the output of any quantum-limited system cacm may 1966 pizer s m ca660510 jb march 3 1978 9:47 am
