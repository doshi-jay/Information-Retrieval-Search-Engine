the augmented predictive analyzer for context-free languages-its relative efficiency it has been proven by greibach that for a given context-free grammar g a standard-form grammar gs can be constructed which generates the same languages as is generated by g and whose rules are all of the form z  cy1  ym m  o where z and yi are intermediate symbols and c a terminal symbol since the predictive analyzer at harvard uses a standard-form grammar it can accept the language of any context-free grammar g given an equivalent standard-form grammar gs the structural descriptions sdgsx assigned to a given sentence x by the predictive analyzer however are usually different from the structural descriptions sdgx assigned to the same sentence by the original context-free grammar g from which gs is derived in section 1 an algorithm originally due to abbott is described standard-form grammar each of whose rules is in standard form supplemented by additional information describing its derivation from the original context-free grammar a technique for performing the sdgsx to sdgx transformation effectively is also described in section 2 the augmented predictive analyzer as a parsing algorithm for arbitrary context-free languages is compared with two other parsing algorithms a selective top-to-bottom algorithm similar to irons error correcting clean algorithm and an immediate constituent analyzer which is an extension of sakai-cockes algorithm for normal grammars the comparison is based upon several criteria of efficiency covering core-storage requirements complexities of the programs and processing time cacm november 1966 kunos ca661108 jb march 2 1978 3:11 pm
