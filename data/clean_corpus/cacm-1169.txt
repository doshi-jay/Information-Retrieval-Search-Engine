an algorithm for minimizing backboard wiring functions a partially exhaustive algorithm is presented for solving the following problem arising from automatic layout of a computer given an ordered set e1 e2 en of n computer components for each permutation of the elements e1 e2 en there is attached a value of an integer function f the algorithm finds a local minimum of f by evaluating the set delta f of the increments corresponding to a certain set of exchanges of two elementshen the exchange corresponding to the least negative increment of delta f is performed the process is iterated and stopped when the set of the increments is a positive or empty set which it is proved corresponds to a minimum the procedure is similar to the downhill method for finding the minimum of a real function fp and can be applied to other placement problems experimental results are presented with backboards formed by many elements and different initial placements cacm november 1965 pomentale t ca651112 jb march 6 1978 4:35 pm
