scan conversion algorithms for a cell organized raster display raster scan computer graphics with real time character generators have previously been limited to alphanumeric characters a display has been described which extends the capabilities of this organization to include general graphics two fundamentally different scan conversion algorithms which have been developed to support this display are presented one is most suitable to non-interactive applications and the other to interactive applications the algorithms were implemented in fortran on the cdc 6400 computer results obtained from the implementations show that the noninteractive algorithms can significantly reduce display file storage requirements at little cost in execution time over that of a conventional raster display the interactive algorithm can improve response time and reduce storage requirements cacm march 1974 barrett r c fordan b w jr graphics scan conversion raster display line drawing discrete image dot generation matrix displays 4.41 6.35 8.2 ca740309 jb january 18 1978 11:08 am
