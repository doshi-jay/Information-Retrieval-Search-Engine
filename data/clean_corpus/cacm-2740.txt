a large semaphore based operating system the paper describes the internal structure of a large operating system as a set of cooperating sequential processes the processes synchronize by means of semaphores and extended semaphores queue semaphores the number of parallel processes is carefully justified and the various semaphore constructions are explained the system is proved to be free of deadly embrace deadlock the design principle is an alternative to dijkstras hierarchical structuring of operating systems the project management and the performance are discussed too the operating system is the first large one using the rc 4000 multiprogramming system cacm july 1975 lauesen s cooperating processes operating system semaphores semaphore applications queue semaphores deadlock deadly embrace hierarchical structuring multiprogramming operating system structure asynchronous structuring buffering parallel processes synchronizing primitives reentrant code rc 4000 project management time schedule debugging project planning project scheduling reliability program proving coroutines correctness program maintenance software paging 4.30 4.31 4.32 4.42 4.43 5.24 ca750702 jb january 9 1978 10:32 am
