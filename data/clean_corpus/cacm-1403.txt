a method for finding the m smallest values of a monotonic function defined on ordered sets of positive integers the minimum value of a monotonic increasing function defined on a partially ordered set s is assumed on the set of minimal points of s this observation is used to devise an efficient method for finding the m smallest functional values of monotonic functions defined on ordered pairs of positive integers the method is easily extended to include monotonic functions defined on ordered n-tuples included is a fortran program which was written to implement the procedure for a certain important case cacm july 1966 sigillito v g ca660709 jb march 2 1978 9:13 pm
