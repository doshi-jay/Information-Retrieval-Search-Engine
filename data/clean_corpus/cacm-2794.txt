state-space problem-reduction and theorem proving-some relationships this paper suggests a bidirectional relationship between state-space and problem-reduction representations it presents a formalism based on multiple-input and multiple-output operators which provides a basis for viewing the two types of representations in this manner a representation of the language recognition problem which is based on the cocke parsing algorithm is used as an illustration a method for representing problems in first-order logic in such a way that the inference system employed by a resolution-based theorem prover determines whether the set of clauses is interpreted in the state-spacer mode or in the problem-reduction mode is presented the analogous concepts in problem-reduction and theorem proving and the terminology used to refer to them are noted the relationship between problem-reduction input resolution and linear resolution is discussed cacm february 1975 vanderbrug g j minker j artificial intelligence state-space representation problem-reduction representation theorem proving language recognition 3.64 ca750205 jb january 12 1978 8:27 am
