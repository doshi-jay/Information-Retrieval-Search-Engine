automatic data structure choice in a language of very high level setl is a set-theoretically oriented language of very high level whose repertoire of semantic objects includes finite sets ordered n-tuples and sets of ordered n-tuples usable as mappings this paper describes the structure of an optimizer for this language among other methods of interest the optimizer uses techniques which allow relations of inclusion and membership to be established the domains and ranges of tabulated mappings to be estimated from above and below and the single-valuedness of tabulated mappings to be proved once facts of this kind have been established automatic choice of data structures becomes possible the methods employed are based upon and extend known techniques of data flow analysis cacm december 1975 schwartz j t program optimization automatic programming high-level languages set-theoretic languages data structure choice 4.12 4.20 4.22 ca751208 jb january 5 1978 3:53 pm
