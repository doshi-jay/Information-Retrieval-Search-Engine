sequential formula translation the syntax of an algorithmic language such as algol is conveniently described as a sequence of states indicated by an element called cellar transitions are controlled by admissible state-symbol pairs which may be represented by a transition matrix this description of syntax furnishes at the same time an extremely simple rule for translating into machine programs statements in the algorithmic language sequential treatment however is not feasible in the case of certain optimizing processes such as recursive address calculation cacm february 1960 samelson k bauer f l ca600208 jb march 22 1978 2:17 pm
