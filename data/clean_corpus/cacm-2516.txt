hierarchical storage in information retrieval a probabilistic analysis is employed to determine the effect of hierarchical storage organizations on information retrieval operations the data storage hardware is assumed to consist on n-levels of linearly connected memory hardware with increasing data access times and increasing data storage capabilities a system might for example consist of fast semiconductor memory computer core memory extended core storage disk memory and data cells equations are derived to predict the effect of such a system on data access times using sequential files random access files and structured files employing multiple-hierarchical linked lists cacm may 1973 salasin j information retrieval hierarchical storage 3.70 3.72 3.73 3.74 3.79 3.90 6.20 6.34 ca730504 jb january 24 1978 8:48 am
