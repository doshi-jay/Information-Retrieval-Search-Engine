on the numerical solution of an n-point boundary value problem for linear ordinary differential equations a method for the numerical solution of then-point boundary value problem for homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations is developed the method requires two runge-kutta integrations over the interval under consideration and the solution of a linear system of equations with n-1 unknowns cacm april 1965 day j t ca650417 jb march 7 1978 3:30 pm
