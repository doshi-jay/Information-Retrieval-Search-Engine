beyond programming languages as computer technology matures our growing ability to create large systems is leading to basic changes in the nature of programming current programming language concepts will not be adequate for building and maintaining systems of the complexity called for by the tasks we attempt just as high level languages enabled the programmer to escape from the intricacies of a machines order code higher level programming systems can provide the means to understand and manipulate complex systems and components in order to develop such systems we need to shift our attention away from the detailed specification of algorithms towards the description of the properties of the packages and objects with which we build this paper analyzes some of the shortcomings of programming languages as they now exist and lays out some possible directions for future research cacm july 1979 winograd t programming programming languages programming systems systems development 4.0 4.20 4.22 4.40 ca790701 dh august 22 1979 2:00 pm
