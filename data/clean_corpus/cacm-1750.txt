considerations in the design of a multiple computer system with extended core storage the use of large quantities of addressable but not executable fast random access memory to heighten the multiprogramming performance of a multicomputer system is discussed the general design of the hardware arrangement and the software components and functions of such a system are based on a planned configuration of dual cdc 6600s that share one million words of extended core storage in the generalization of such a design special emphasis is placed on estimating expected gains when compared with the traditional configuration of separate and independent computers without extended core storage an observation is made on the use of conventional slower speed random access storage devices in place of the faster memory cacm may 1968 fuchel k heller s multiple computer systems extended core storage multiprogrammed operating systems multiprocessor operating systems control data corporation 6600 operating system with ecs 4.30 4.32 ca680506 jb february 23 1978 9:27 am
