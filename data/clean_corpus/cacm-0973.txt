estimation of heart parameters using skin potential measurements a fundamental problem of vector cardiography is the estimation of the state of the heart on the basis of skin potential measurements a mathematical model relating ventricular dipoles to surface potentials is sketched then it is shown that the inverse problem-that of determining electrical heart parameters on the basis of skin potential measurements-may be viewed as a nonlinear multipoint boundary value problem a feasible solution employing quasilinearization and high-speed digital computers is given cacm november 1964 bellman r collier c kagiwada h kalaba r selvester r ca641110 jb march 9 1978 4:00 pm
