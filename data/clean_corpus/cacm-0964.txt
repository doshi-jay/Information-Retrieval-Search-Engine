mechanization of tedious algebra-the e coefficients of theoretical chemistry a table of formulas for certain integrals involving legendre functions has been constructed mechanically by a program which performed algebraic operations the formulas are all rational algebraic expressions in a single variable and were constructed by a recurrence procedure they are of interest in molecular quantum chemistry trivial coding techniques were used to write the relevant programs in fortran the results were photo composed on a photon s-560 system that was controlled by tapes which were punched directly from the computer output so avoiding manual keyboarding transcription errors and keyboarded correction cacm december 1964 wactlar h d barnett m p ca641207 jb march 9 1978 3:38 pm
