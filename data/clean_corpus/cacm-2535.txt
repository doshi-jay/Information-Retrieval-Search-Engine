the effects of multiplexing on a computer-communications system a study is made of the way in which asynchronous time division multiplexing changes the stochastic nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer and consequently affects the performance of a time-shared computer-communications system it is concluded that while for certain values of system parameters there is noticeable improvement in the performance of the computer model in the sense that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced these improvements are offset by the transmission delays imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or no change in the computer-communications system performance analytical and simulation results are based on the model of the computer-communications system being an m/d/1 queue the multiplexor in tandem with a single exponential server the computer analytical results include a general description of the output process of an m/d/1 queue and the conditions under which this output process is approximately poisson cacm march 1973 pack c d computer communications time-sharing multiplexing scheduling algorithms operating systems 3.80 3.81 6.20 ca730304 jb january 24 1978 11:13 am
