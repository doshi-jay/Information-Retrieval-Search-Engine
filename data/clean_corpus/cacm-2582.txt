improving locality by critical working sets a new approach to program locality improvement via restructuring is described the method is particularly suited to those systems where primary memory is managed according to a working set strategy it is based on the concept of critical working set a working set which does not contain the next memory reference the data the method operates upon are extracted from a trace of the program to be restructured it is shown that except in some special cases the method is not optimum however the experimental results obtained by using the method to restructure an interactive text editor and the file system module of an operating system have shown its substantial superiority over the other methods proposed in the literature cacm november 1974 ferrari d program restructuring program segmentation locality improvement memory hierarchies virtual memory multiprogramming restructuring techniques static restructuring dynamic restructuring working set strategy critical working set 4.32 4.39 4.43 4.49 4.9 ca741102 jb january 16 1978 10:50 am
