some performance tests of quicksort and descendants detailed performance evaluations are presented for six acm algorithms quicksort no 64 shellsort no 201 stringsort no 207 treesort3 no 245 quickersort no 271 and qsort no 402 algorithms 271 and 402 are refinements of algorithm 64 and all three are discussed in some detail the evidence given here demonstrates that qsort no 402 requires many more comparisons than its author claims of all these algorithms quickersort requires the fewest comparisons to sort random arrays cacm march 1974 loeser r sorting in-place sorting sorting efficiency sorting performance tests quicksort quickersort qsort shellsort stringsort treesort3utility sort algorithm general-purpose sort algorithm sorting algorithm documentation 4.49 5.31 ca740304 jb january 18 1978 11:26 am
