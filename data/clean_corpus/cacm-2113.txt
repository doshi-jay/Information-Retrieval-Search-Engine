the multistore parser for hierarchical syntactic structures a syntactic parser is described for hierarchical concatenation patterns that are presented to the analyzer in the form of linear strings particular emphasis is given to the system of significant addresses by means of which processing times for large-scale matching procedures can be substantially reduced the description makes frequent use of examples taken from the fully operational implementation of the parser in an experimental english sentence analyzer by structuring an area of the computers central core storage in such a way that the individual locations of bytes and bits come to represent the data involved in the matching procedure the shifting of information is reduced to a minimum and the searching of lists is eliminated altogether the matches are traced by means of binary masks and the state of single bits determines the operational flow of the procedure the method could be implemented with any interpretive grammar provided it can be expressed by the functional classification of the items composing the input hierarchical structures cacm february 1970 von glasersfeld e parsing syntactic analysis natural-language analysis linguistic data processing computational linguistics correlational grammar structure recognition pattern recognition matching procedures tree-structure interpretation machine translation automatic abstracting 3.42 3.49 3.63 3.70 3.71 ca700202 jb february 14 1978 12:57 pm
