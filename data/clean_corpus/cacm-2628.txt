minimal-total-processing time drum and disk scheduling disciplines this article investigates the application of minimal-total-processing-time mtpt scheduling disciplines to rotating storage units when random arrival of requests is allowed fixed-head drum and moving-head drum and moving-head disk storage units are considered and emphasis is placed on the relative merits of the mtpt scheduling discipline with respect to the shortest-latency-time-first sltf scheduling discipline the results of the simulation studies presented show that neither scheduling discipline is unconditionally superior to the other for most fixed-head drum applications the sltf discipline is preferable to mtpt but for intra-cylinder disk scheduling the mtpt discipline offers a distinct advantage over the sltf discipline the computational requirements of an algorithm that implements the mtpt scheduling discipline are shown to be comparable to sltf algorithms in both cases the sorting procedure is the most time-consuming phase of the algorithm cacm july 1974 fuller s h drum scheduling disk scheduling shortest-latency-time-first sltf minimal-total-processing-time mtpt rotating storage units 4.31 4.41 6.34 6.35 ca740703 jb january 17 1978 1:07 pm
