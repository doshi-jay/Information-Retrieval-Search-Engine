a new method for determining linear precedence functions for precedence grammars the precedence relations of a precedence grammar can be precisely described by a two-dimensional precedence matrix often the information in the matrix can be represented more concisely by a pair of vectors called linear precedence functions a new algorithm is presented for obtaining the linear precedence functions when given the precedence matrix this algorithm is shown to possess several computational advantages cacm october 1969 bell j r boolean matrices syntax precedence grammar context-free parsing transition matrix precedence functions 4.12 ca691010 jb february 15 1978 3:13 pm
