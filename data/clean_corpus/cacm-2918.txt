multiprocessor memory organization and memory interference the structure of shared memory in a multiprocessor computer system is examined with particular attention to nonin terleaved memory alternative memory organizations are compared and it is shown that a home memory organization in which each processor is associated with one or more memories in which its address space is concentrated is quite effective in reducing memory in terference home memory organization is shown to be particularly suited to certain specialized computation problems as well as to possess advantages in terms of in terference and reliability for general purpose computation results for in terleaved memory are drawn from previous work and are used for comparison trace-driven simulations are used to verify the conclusions of the analysis cacm october 1977 smith a j memory in terference interleaving multiprocessing trace-driven simulation queueing theory shared memory 4.30 4.32 6.34 ca771008 jb december 27 1977 10:28 am
