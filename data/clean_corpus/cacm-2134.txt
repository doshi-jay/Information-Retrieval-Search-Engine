an extension of the munkres algorithm for the assignment problem to rectangular matrices the assignment problem together with munkres proposed algorithm for its solution in square matrices is presented first then the authors develop an extension of this algorithm which permits a solution for rectangular matrices timing results obtained by using an adapted version of silvers algol procedure are discussed and a relation between solution time and problem size is given cacm december 1971 bourgeois f lassalle j operations research optimization theory assignment problem rectangular matrices algorithm 5.39 5.40 ca711209 jb february 2 1978 9:46 am
