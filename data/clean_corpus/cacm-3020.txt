systematic recursion removal the recursion removal algorithm presented by strong and walker is amplified and applied to a relatively complex pl/i program the aim is to demonstrate systematic recursion-removal techniques on something more complex than knuths sturdy toddler and to obtain measurements of the cost of procedure linkage in pl/i and the savings achievable via procedure integration in the presence of recursion first the paper describes the recursion-removal process and the example on which it will be illustrated recursion removal is then applied to the two major parts of this example and the final result of the process is displayed our performance comparison results are presented and our conclusions are briefly discussed cacm february 1978 auslander m strong h recursion removal recursion elimination optimization procedure linkage procedure integration 4.19 4.49 4.9 5.24 ca780203 jb march 28 1978 4:26 pm
