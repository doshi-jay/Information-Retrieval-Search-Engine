euler a generalization algol and its formal definition part i a method for defining programming languages is developed which introduces a rigorous relationship between structure and meaning the structure of a language is defined by a phrase structure syntax the meaning in terms of the effects which the execution of a sequence of interpretation rules exerts upon a fixed set of variables called the environment there exists a one-to-one correspondence between syntactic rules and interpretation rules is determined by the sequence of corresponding syntactic reductions which constitute a clean the individual interpretation rules are explained in terms of an elementary an d obvious algorithmic notation a constructive method for evaluating a text is provided and for certain decidable classes of languages their unambiguity is proved as an example a generalization of algol is described in full detail to demonstrate that concepts like block-structure procedures parameters etc can be defined adequately and precisely by this method cacm january 1966 wirth n weber h ca660104 jb march 3 1978 4:22 pm
