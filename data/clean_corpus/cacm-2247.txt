on the criteria to be used in decomposing systems into modules this paper discusses modularization as a mechanism for improving the flexibility ad comprehensibility of a system while allowing the shortening of its development time the effectiveness of a modularization is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules a system design problem is presented and both a conventional and unconventional decomposition are described it is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined the criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed the unconventional decomposition if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines will be less efficient in most cases an alternative approach to implementation which does not have this effect is sketched cacm december 1972 parnas d l software modules modularity software engineering kwic index software design 4.0 ca721208 jb january 27 1978 11:09 am
