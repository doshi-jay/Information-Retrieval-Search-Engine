decomposability instabilities and saturation in multiprogramming systems a step-by-step approach to model the dynamic behavior and evaluate the performance of computing systems is proposed it is based on a technique of variable aggregation and the concept of nearly decomposable system both borrowed from econometrics this approach is taken in order to identify in multiprogramming paging systems i unstable regimes of operations and ii critical computing loads which bring the system into states of saturation this analysis leads to a more complete definition of the circumstances in which thrashing can set in cacm july 1975 courtois p j multiprogramming paging performance evaluation saturation instabilities thrashing aggregation system levels hierarchynetworks of queues 4.31 4.32 8.1 8.2 ca750701 jb january 9 1978 10:39 am
