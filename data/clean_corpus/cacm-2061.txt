an algorithm for the construction of bounded-context parsers an algorithm is described which accepts an arbitrary context-free grammar and constructs a bounded-context parser for it whenever such a parser exists in the first part of the paper the definition of a context-free grammar and the working of a bounded-context parser are recalled the notion of reduction class for a context-free grammar is then introduced and its connection with the structure of a bounded-context parser is indicated next pushdown automata which generate the different reduction classes of a context-free grammar are defined finally the algorithm is described it essentially carries out an exhaustive study of all possible runs of the pushdown automata generating the reduction classes in the second part the utility of the algorithm is discuss ed in the light of the experience gained from its use in compiler design the algorithm is claimed to be particularly useful in the simultaneous design of a language and a compiler for it cacm may 1970 loeckx j bounded-context parsing bounded-context syntactic analysis parser construction syntactical analyzer construction generators compiler compilers compiler writing systems translator writing systems metacompilers context-free grammars formal languages pushdown automata 4.12 5.22 5.23 ca700505 jb february 13 1978 1:58 pm
