three criteria for designing computing systems to facilitate debugging the designer of a computing system should adopt explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting proposed system features three possible criteria of this kind are input recordability input specifiability and asynchronous reproducibility of output these criteria imply that a user can if he desires either know or control all the influences affecting the content and extent of his computers output to define the scope of the criteria the notion of an abstract machine of a programming language and the notion of a virtual computer are explained examples of applications of the criteria concern the reading of a time-of-day clock the synchronization of parallel processes protection in multiprogrammed systems and the assignment of capability indexes cacm may 1968 van horn e c computer design computer design criteria computer systems computer systems design input equipment input equipment design operating systems operating systems design multiprogramming multiprogrammed systems multiprogrammed system design virtual computers programming languages programming language design program semantics programming language semantics determinism reproducibility repeatability deterministic computers protection memory protection information security information privacy computing reliability debugging program debugging program testing parallel processing parallel programming multiprocessing 2.11 4.12 4.13 4.20 4.30 4.42 4.43 5.24 6.20 6.35 ca680509 jb february 23 1978 9:06 am
