dynamic space-sharing in computer systems a formalization of relationships between space-shading program behavior and processor efficiency in computer systems is presented concepts of value and cost of space allocation per task are defined and then value and cost are combined to develop a single parameter termed value per unit cost the intent is to illustrate a possible analytic approach to the investigation of the problems of space-sharing and to demonstrate the method on sample problems cacm may 1969 belady l a kuehner c j space-sharing storage allocation memory allocation storage management memory management program behavior multiprogramming computer system design allocation strategies replacement strategies demand-paging time-sharing 4.32 6.2 6.20 ca690508 jb february 17 1978 3:31 pm
