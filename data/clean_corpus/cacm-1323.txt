a correspondence between algol 60 and churchs lambda-notation part i this paper describes how some of the semantics of algol 60 can be formalized by establishing a correspondence between expressions of algol 60 and expressions in a modified form of churchs l-notation first a model for computer languages and compute behavior is described based on the notions of functional application and functional abstraction but also having analogues for imperative language features then this model is used as an abstract object language into which algol 60 is mapped many of algol 60s features emerge as particular arrangements of a small number of structural rules suggesting new classifications and generalizations the correspondence is first described informally mainly by illustrations the second part of the paper gives a formal description ie an abstract compiler into the abstract objct language this is itself presented in a purely functional notation that is one using only application and abstraction cacm february 1965 landin p j ca650201 jb march 7 1978 11:26 pm
