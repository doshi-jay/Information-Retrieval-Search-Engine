a comparison of tree-balancing algorithms several algorithms-height-balance ie avl and extensions weight-balance ie bb and wb and total restructuring-for building balanced binary search trees are compared the criteria for comparison encompass theoretical aspects eg path lengths and implementation independent and machine/algorithm-dependent measures eg run time a detailed analysis of code is also presented at a level believed to be language-and compiler-independent the quality of the resulting trees and the overhead spent on building them are analyzed and some guidelines are given for an efficient use of the methods if insertion and subsequent queries are the only operations of in terest then pure avl trees present the overall best qualities cacm may 1977 baer j l schwab b binary search trees avl trees weight-balanced trees path length analysis of algorithms information storage and retrieval 3.7 3.72 3.74 5.31 ca770504 jb december 29 1977 2:16 am
