abstract data types and the development of data structures abstract data types can play a significant role in the development of software that is reliable efficient and flexible this paper presents and discusses the application of an algebraic technique for the specification of abstract data types among the examples presented is a top-down development of a symbol table for a block structured language a discussion of the proof of its correctness is given the paper also contains a brief discussion of the problems involved in constructing algebraic specifications that are both consistent and complete cacm june 1977 guttag j abstract data type correctness proof data type data structure specification software specification 4.34 5.24 ca770605 jb december 29 1977 1:17 am
