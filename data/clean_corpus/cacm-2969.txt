optimal program and data locations in computer networks an optimization procedure for the allocation of program and data files in a computer network is presented this algorithm takes into account the dependencies between files and programs such as occur in real heterogeneous computer networks insights into whether or not to convert programs from one computer to another can also be gained from the model a search procedure for the file location problem is described along with an example and a possible application of the model cacm may 1977 morgan h l levin k d computer networks databases distributed databases optimal file location 3.81 3.51 4.33 ca770503 jb december 29 1977 2:22 am
