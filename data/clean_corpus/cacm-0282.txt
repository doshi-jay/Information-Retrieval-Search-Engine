optimum tape-writing procedures consider a magnetic tape system with a read check after writing where an error occurs in writing a record a programmed error routine may either bypass some or all of the area on tape or try to rewrite the record on the same area this paper evaluates these two procedures on the basis of expected loss of computer time and develops a decision rule for selecting the optimum procedure the rule depends critically on the number of times the tape being written will be used in the future in the case where the optimum procedure is to bypass an area a second decision-the size of the area to be bypassed-is necessary a formula is developed to determine the optimum area to be bypassed for each procedure cacm september 1961 hutchinson k ca610912 jb march 16 1978 1:32 pm
