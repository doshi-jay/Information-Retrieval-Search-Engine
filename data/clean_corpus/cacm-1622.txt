an efficient procedure for the generation of closed subsets an efficient algorithm is described for generating subsets of a set s which satisfy constraints of the form if si is a member of the subset then sj must also be a member of the subset the algorithm has been programmed in the wisp language and successfully run on the ibm 7094 in connection with a routine to detect feedback in multidimensional iterative networks cacm march 1967 waite w m ca670307 jb february 28 1978 1:18 pm
