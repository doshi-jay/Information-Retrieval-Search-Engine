an interpretive input routine for linear programming in this descriptive article an input code is presented which greatly simplifies data input to any linear programming solution routine for subsequent use either as a pedagogical device or for solving rather small lp problems this latter limited use derives not at all from inherent limitations in the code itself but from an efficiency evaluation large lp problems would doubtless benefit from an input system more suited for bulk data handling than the input code described from a users standpoint input appears almost exactly as a textbook presentation of the lp problem limited only by a keypunchs inability to write subscripts etc the input interpreter scans column wise thus no fixed format data preparation is required the user may also under very general requirements only liberally use editorial comments throughout the input deck as an aid in identification eg of row constraints the article includes examples of input output from a solution routine presently in use and a skeleton flowchart of the input interpreter cacm january 1967 aigner d j ca670104 jb march 1 1978 8:58 am
