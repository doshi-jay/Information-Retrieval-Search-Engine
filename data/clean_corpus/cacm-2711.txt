a vector space model for automatic indexing in a document retrieval or other pattern matching environment where stored entities documents are compared with each other or with incoming patterns search requests it appears that the best indexing property space is one where each entity lies as far away from the others as possible in these circumstances the value of an indexing system may be expressible as a function of the density of the object space in particular retrieval performance may correlate inversely with space density an approach based on space density computations is used to choose an optimum indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents typical evaluation results are shown demonstrating the usefulness of the model cacm november 1975 salton g wong a yang c s automatic information retrieval automatic indexing content analysis document space 3.71 3.73 3.74 3.75 ca751101 jb january 6 1978 10:14 am
