thinning algorithms on rectangular hexagonal and triangular arrays in this report three thinning algorithms are developed one each for use with rectangular hexagonal and triangular arrays the approach to the development of each algorithm is the same pictorial results produced by each of the algorithms are presented and the relative performances of the algorithms are compared it is found that the algorithm operating with the triangular array is the most sensitive to image irregularities and noise yet it will yield a thinned image with an overall reduced number of points it is concluded that the algorithm operating in conjunction with the hexagonal array has features which strike a balance between those of the other two arrays cacm september 1972 deutsch e s thinning algorithms rectangular hexagonal triangular arrays image processing skeleton 3.64 ca720907 jb january 27 1978 4:25 pm
