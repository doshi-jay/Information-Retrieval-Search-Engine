game interpretation of the deadlock avoidance problem the deadlock avoidance problem may be defined informally as the determination from some a priori information about the processes resources operating system etc of the safe situations which may be realized without endangering the smooth running of the system when each process specifies its future needs by a flowchart of need-defined steps a global approach to the phenomenon and its in terpretation as a game between the operating system and the processes allows formalization of risk and safety concepts the bipartite graph representation of this game may then be used to construct explicitly the set of safe states and to study their properties cacm october 1977 devillers r operating system multiprogramming time-sharing resource allocation deadlock in terlock deadly embrace deadlock avoidance flowchart 4.30 4.32 ca771006 jb december 27 1977 10:50 am
