segment sizes and lifetimes in algol 60 programs the characteristics of the virtual memory requirements of a sample of algol 60 programs have been measured distributions are presented for thesizes of memory requests and for their holding times lifetimes the results are presented in terms of johnstons contour model and a simple abstract machine they provide new empirical evidence of certain aspects of the construction and behavior of real programs and some of their implications for the design of virtual memory systems are presented and discussed cacm january 1977 batson a p brundage r e virtual memory program behavior segmentation storage allocation algol 60 contour model 4.22 4.34 4.45 6.21 ca770105 jb january 3 1978 12:05 am
