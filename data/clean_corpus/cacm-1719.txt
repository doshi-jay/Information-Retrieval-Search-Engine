a methodology for calculating and optimizing real-time system performance the continually increasing size complexity number of types and cost of data processing systems are causing serious re-examination within government and industry of the criteria for and methods of calculating and optimizing data processing system cost and performance real-time data processing systems as typified by the automated airline reservation system are discussed in this paper criteria for evaluating performance are described a methodology for calculating and optimizing is outlined and the method is illustrated by carrying out a portion of the performance calculation and the optimization of a drum-oriented message switching system cacm july 1968 stimler s brons k a real-time system analysis real-time system design real-time system performance criteria real-time system cost performance ratio 3.27 3.80 3.81 3.89 6.9 ca680710 jb february 22 1978 11:40 am
