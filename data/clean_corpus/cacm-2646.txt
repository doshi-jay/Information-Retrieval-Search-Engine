a model for masking rotational latency by dynamic disk allocation this paper presents the background and algorithms for masking the rotational latency of a disk or drum it discusses the anticipatory input and output of blocks of data to buffer and primary memories for a mono-programmed computer system a basic permutation algorithm and several variations are given because of the anticipatory nature of the i/o scheduling these algorithms are restricted to classes of programs with predictable behavior while the methods are not restricted to numerical computations matrix and partial differential equation methods are typical examples of their use it is shown that latency may be masked using a small amount of buffer memory the methods discussed are independent of the overall size of the data base being considered cacm may 1974 gold d e kuck d j buffer memory memory hierarchy permutation algorithm rotational latency staging storage allocation 4.41 6.20 ca740507 jb january 17 1978 3:59 pm
