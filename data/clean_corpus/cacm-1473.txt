the stability of the fourth order runge-kutta method for the solution of systems of differential equations the problem of the region of stability of the fourth order-runge-kutta method for the solution of systems of differential equations is studied this region can be characterized by means of linear transformation but can not be given in a closed form in the paper this region is determined by the electronic digital computer z22 cacm february 1966 karim a i a ca660211 jb march 3 1978 2:31 pm
