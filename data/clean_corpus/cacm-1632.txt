programming the tabular method of analysis of variance for factorial experiments the ease of programming the tabular method of analysis of variance for complete factorial experiments in a fortran language is demonstrated in this method the total sum of squares is partitioned into orthogonal single degree of freedom sums of squares main effect and interaction sums of squares are then obtained by appropriate pooling of the single degree of freedom sums of squares program segments to accomplish the procedure are presented modifications to handle hierarchical designs and replicated experiments are mentioned a fortran ii program for an ibm 7094 is described briefly cacm february 1967 carmer s g ca670210 jb february 28 1978 2:33 pm
