some new upper bounds on the generation of prime numbers given an integer n what is the computational complexity of finding all the primes less than n a modified sieve of eratosthenes using doubly linked lists yields an algorithm of on arithmetic complexity this upper bound is shown to be equivalent to the theoretical lower bound for sieve methods without preprocessing use of preprocessing techniques involving space-time and additive-multiplicative tradeoffs reduces this upper bound to on/log logn and the bit complexity to on logn log log logn a storage requirement is described using on logn/log logn bits as well cacm september 1977 mairson h g computational complexity sieve prime number generation number theory linked list preprocessing balancing 5.25 5.39 ca770907 jb december 27 1977 12:55 pm
