the selection of optimal tab settings a new generation of computer terminals allows tab settings to be selected and set by the computer this feature can be used to reduce the number of characters that are needed to represent a document for transmission and printing in this note an algorithm is given for selecting the optimal set of tab stops for minimizing the number of characters transmitted an implementation of the algorithm has reduced the number of characters transmitted by from 7 to 30 percent but requires a prepass through the document to compute a matrix used in determining the optimal set tab stops the use of fixed tab stops as a heuristic alternative can achieve about 80 percent of optimal with no prepass cacm december 1978 peterson j bitner j howard j tabs word processing dynamic programming 3.9 4.4 ca781203 dh january 18 1979 4:34 pm
