some ideas on data types in high-level languages a number of issues are explored concerning the notion that a data type is a set of values together with a set of primitive operations on those values among these are the need for a notation for iterating over the elements of any finite set instead of the more narrow for i 1 to n notation the use of the domain of an array as a data type the need for a simple notation for allowing types of parameters to be themselves parameters but in a restrictive fashion and resulting problems with conversion of values from one type to another cacm june 1977 gries d gehani n data types generic procedures programming languages 4.12 4.20 4.22 ca770607 jb december 28 1977 1:27 pm
