integral equations of immunology the inversion of a particular integral equation of the first fredholm kind is the basic problem considered the strategy which yielded success consisted of three essential points 1 fit the known experimental data by a curve with properties which derive from properties of the as yet unknown function 2 stabilize the computation for the unknown function by using singular value decomposition 3 constrain the unknown function approximation since it represents a probability distribution to be nonnegative a number of test cases are presented one set of actual experimental data is analyzed with the procedures presented cacm october 1972 hanson r j integral equations of the first kind nonnegative constraints singular value analysis 3.10 5.14 5.18 5.41 ca721003 jb january 27 1978 3:37 pm
