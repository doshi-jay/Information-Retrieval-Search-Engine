the synthesis of loop predicates current methods for mechanical program verification require a complete predicate specification on each loop because this is tedious and error prone producing a program with complete correct predicates is reasonably difficult and would be facilitated by machine assistance this paper discusses techniques for mechanically synthesizing loop predicates two classes of techniques are considered 1 heuristic methods which derive loop predicates from boundary conditions and/or partially specified inductive assertions 2 extraction methods which use input predicates and appropriate weak interpretations to obtain certain classes of loop predicates by an evaluation on the weak interpretation cacm march 1974 wegbreit b program verification loop predicates inductive assertions synthesis of loop predicates weak interpretations well-founded sets property extraction theorem proving 3.64 4.19 4.22 5.24 ca740206 jb january 18 1978 12:55 pm
