methods of convergence improvement for some improper integrals in the numerical integration of an improper integral of the first kind it is customary to truncate the integral when the change yielded by the last iteration is less than some predetermined constant the efficiency of such integration schemes can often be improved by use of recent advances in the theory of nonlinear transformations however for several important integrals eg integrals whose integrands are rational polynomials these transformations fail to yield much improvement in this paper several methods of convergence improvement are developed which greatly improve convergence of some improper integrals including the integrals of rational polynomials cacm july 1968 mcwilliams g v thompson r w approximation nonlinear improper integral convergence improvement numerical integration rational polynomials truncation 3.15 5.13 5.16 5.19 ca680707 jb february 22 1978 11:58 am
