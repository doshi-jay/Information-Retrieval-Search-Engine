the distribution of a program in primary and fast buffer storage a virtual memory computer system with a fast buffer cache memory between primary memory and the central processing unit is considered the optimal distribution of a program between the buffer and primary memory is studied using the programs lifetime function expressions for the distribution of a program which maximizes the useful fraction of the cost-time integral of primary and fast buffer storage are obtained for swapping and nonswapping buffer management policies cacm july 1973 gelenbe e cache virtual memory lifetime function cost-time integral fast buffer 4.3 6.2 6.3 ca730705 jb january 23 1978 12:41 pm
