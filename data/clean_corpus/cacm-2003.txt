an interactive software system for computers-aided design an application to circuit project the characteristics of an interactive software system intended to constitute an interface between designer and computer during various steps of the design process are presented the main emphasis is given to the description of the features of the two high level user oriented languages operating at different levels on which the interaction is based the first one is imol an interactive monitor language which is designed to perform the overall and control functions of the software system its design criteria provide the user with commands which are both simple and efficient in order to perform all the functions needed in computer-aided circuit design the second one is coif a circuit oriented graphic language which is designed to describe generate and manipulate graphic problem specifications it is an extension of fortran with graphic-type variables so that the designer who is familiar with fortran need not learn a new language the application to computer-aided circuit design is in particular examined on the other hand the adopted design criteria provide sufficient generality to extend the use of the two languages to different computer-assisted applications cacm september 1970 bracchi g somalvico m interaction graphics computer graphics computer-aided design circuit design software system software organization language monitor language graphic language extended fortran 3.24 3.25 4.13 4.22 4.3 ca700902 jb february 10 1978 2:20 pm
