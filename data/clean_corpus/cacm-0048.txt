shift-register code for indexing applications in this communication the use of a shift-register code with n  10 is described for calling 64 wireless telemetering stations in a fixed cyclical order a high degree of redundancy is used permitting a single-error correcting code minimum-distance-three code with 64 10-bit code words to be employed as the station identification code embedding this in the shift-register code with period 1023 permits the code to be employed without punctuation each of the telemetering station receivers simply putting received ones and zeros into a shift register each time the given code combination arises identifying the particular station barring for tuitous error combinations of very low probability it has been called the communication describes the properties and application of the code in some detail and the finding of the particular example to be employed on ural the soviet-built drum computer donated to the indian statistical institute by the united nations technical aid administration untaa cacm october 1959 nadler m sengupta a ca591011 jb march 22 1978 4:07 pm
