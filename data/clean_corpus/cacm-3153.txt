the control of response times in multi-class systems by memory allocations the possibility of giving different quality of service to jobs of different classes by regulating their memory allocation is examined in the context of a paged computer system two parameterized algorithms which partition the main memory between two classes of jobs are considered initially a closed system consisting of a process or and paging and file devices with fixed numbers of jobs is studied to determine optimal degrees of multiprogramming and the proportion of processor time devoted to each class applying a decomposition approach and treating the closed system as a single server the response times in an open system with external arrivals are studied the object is to investigate the effect of the memory alocation parameters on the expected response times under the two algorithms numerical solutions and economical lower bounds for the expected response times as functions of the control parameters are obtained a way of applying the results to systems with more than two job classes is indicated cacm july 1979 hine j mitrani i tsur s queueing networks paging virtual memory performance control 4.32 8.1 ca790704 dh august 22 1979 3:32 pm
