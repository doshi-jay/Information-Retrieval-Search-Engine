computer construction of project networks project networks are used in pert and cpm an algorithm is given for constructing project networks directly from the project precedence relations the algorithm creates dummy activities and topologically orders the arcs and nodes the number of nodes created is minimal for the given precedence relations it has been experimentally programmed in fortran ii for the ibm 7094 cacm july 1968 fisher a c liebman j s nemhauser g l project networks pert cpm topological ordering network construction by computer 5.32 ca680706 jb february 22 1978 12:07 pm
