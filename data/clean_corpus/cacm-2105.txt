an interactive computer system using graphical flowchart input an interactive computer system operational on a graphical computer terminal is described this system was designed to demonstrate a method of programming by computer interpretation of a flowchart the user draws a description of a sampled-data system and specifies description is transmitted to a large scale computer the design is simulated and a graphic representation of the processed signal is returned to the scope a successful design may require numerous modifications of the original design a graphical interactive system provides an environment to perform this iterative process efficiently and effectively cacm february 1970 robins m f beyer j d simulation program graphical input-output sampled data systems 3.20 3.24 ca700210 jb february 14 1978 9:57 am
