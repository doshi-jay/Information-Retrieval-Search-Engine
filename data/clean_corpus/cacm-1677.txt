storage organization in programming systems the system of program and data representation that has been in use on the rice university computer for five years is described each logical entity in storage occupies a block of consecutive memory locations each block is labeled by a codeword and may contain a program a data vector or codewords which in turn label blocks to form arrays this storage arrangement is discussed with its realized advantages or programming systems simplicity of programmed addressing flexibility of data structures efficiency of memory utilization variability of system composition during execution means of linkage between programs and from programs to data and basis for storage protection the application of labeled blocks may be extended to areas of time-sharing and multimedia storage control on the basis of experience at rice some ideas on such extensions are presented cacm november 1968 jodeit j g storage allocation storage organization storage control codewords data representation program representation data structures storage protection addressing mechanisms paging segmentation file handling 4.30 4.40 6.20 ca681102 jb february 21 1978 3:11 pm
