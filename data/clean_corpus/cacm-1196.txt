applications of differential equations in general problem solving a large class of problems leading to digital computer processing can be formulated in terms of the numerical solution of systems of ordinary differential equations powerful methods are in existence for the solution of such systems a good general purpose routine for the solution of such systems furnishes a powerful tool for processing many problems this is true from the point of view of ease of programming ease of debugging and minimization of computer time a number of examples are discussed in detail cacm september 1965 klopfenstein r w ca650910 jb march 6 1978 7:16 pm
