the treatment of data types in el1 in constructing a general purpose programming language a key issue is providing a sufficient set of data types and associated operations in a manner that permits both natural problem-oriented notation and efficient implementation the el1 language contains a number of features specifically designed to simultaneously satisfy both requirements the resulting treatment of data types includes provision for programmer-defined data types data types and generic routines programmer control over type conversion and very flexible data type behavior in a context that allows efficient compiled code and compact data representation cacm may 1974 wegbreit b data types modes mode unions type conversion coercion generic functions extensible languages data type definition data description language compilation 4.12 4.13 4.22 ca740502 jb january 17 1978 4:32 pm
