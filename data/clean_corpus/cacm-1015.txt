near-minimax polynomial approximations and partitioning of intervals a method of near-minimax polynomial approximation is described as a by-product this method provides a formula for an estimate of the maximum error associated with a given degree of approximation using this formula a partitioning algorithm is obtained for dividing a basic interval into subintervals for which approximations of equal degree give equal maximum error cacm august 1964 fraser w hart j f ca640815 jb march 9 1978 6:41 pm
