a program to solve the pentomino problem by the recursive use of macros a coding technique is described in which certain macro-instructions are given lists as arguments and are thereby used recursively the discussion covers primarily an example in which the technique is used to solve the pentomino problem-the problem of fitting 12 pentominos without overlapping into a plane area formed of 60 elemental squares cacm october 1965 fletcher j g ca651010 jb march 6 1978 6:37 pm
