reducing truncation errors by programming in accumulating a sum such as in a numerical integration with a large number of intervals the sum itself becomes much larger than the individual addends this may produce a less accurate sum as the number of intervals is increased separate variables can be established as accumulators to hold partial sums within various distinct intervals thus the extensive successive truncations are eliminated cacm june 1964 wolfe j m ca640615 jb march 9 1978 9:22 pm
