communicating sequential processes this paper suggests that input and output are basic primitives of programming and that parallel composition of communicating sequential processes is a fundamental program structuring method when combined with a development of dijkstras guarded command these concepts are surprisingly versatile their use is illustrated by sample solutions of a variety of familiar programming exercises cacm august 1978 hoare c programming programming languages programming primitives program structures parallel programming concurrency input output guarded commands nondeterminacy coroutines procedures multiple entries multiple exits classes data representations recursion conditional critical regions monitors iterative arrays 4.20 4.22 4.32 ca780805 dh february 7 1979 10:07 am
