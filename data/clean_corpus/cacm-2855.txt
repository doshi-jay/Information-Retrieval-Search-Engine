an efficient list-moving algorithm using constant workspace an efficient algorithm is presented for moving arbitrary list structures using no storage apart from program variables other than that required to hold the original list and the copy the original list is destroyed as it is moved no mark bits are necessary but pointers to the copy must be distinguishable from pointers to the original the algorithm is superior in execution speed to previous algorithms for the same problem some variations and extensions of the algorithm are discussed cacm june 1976 clark d w list moving list copying lisp space complexity constant workspace 4.34 4.49 5.25 ca760607 jb january 4 1978 1:43 pm
