regular expression search algorithm a method for locating specific character strings embedded in character text is described and an implementation of this method in the form of a compiler is discussed the compiler accepts a regular expression as source language and produces an ibm 7094 program as object language the object program then accepts the text to be searched as input and produces a signal every time an embedded string in the text matches the given regular expression examples problems and solution are also presented cacm june 1968 thompson k search match regular expression 3.74 4.49 5.32 ca680606 jb february 22 1978 4:18 pm
