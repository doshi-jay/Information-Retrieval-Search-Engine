digital simulation of discrete flow systems the discrete flow systems discussed are characterized by the movement of randomly arriving items along interacting channels programing a digital computer to simulate such systems utilizes some techniques not common in other approaches to physical problems the principal portion of the paper is a discussion of two simulation studies that illustrate some of the programming problems involved one is of an extensive package-handling plant with the objective being optimization of parameters such as storage capacities and processing rates in the other air traffic flow and control procedures are simulated to compare the effects of alternative control decisions cacm december 1960 moore c j lewis t s ca601212 jb march 20 1978 6:27 pm
