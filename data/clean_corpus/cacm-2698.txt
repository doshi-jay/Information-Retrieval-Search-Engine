syntax-directed least-errors analysis for context-free languages a practical approach a least-errors recognizer is developed informally using the well-known recognizer of earley along with elements of bellmans dynamic programming the analyzer takes a general class of context-free grammars as drivers and any finite string as input recognition consists of a least-errors count for a corrected version of the input relative to the driver grammar the algorithm design emphasizes practical aspects which help in programming it cacm january 1974 lyon g arbitrary input strings context-free grammars parsing dynamic programming stored subanalyses separability state merging least-errors correction 4.12 5.23 5.42 ca740101 jb january 18 1978 2:57 pm
