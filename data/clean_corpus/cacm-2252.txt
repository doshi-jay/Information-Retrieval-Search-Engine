a method for incrementally compiling languages with nested statement structure a method of incremental compilation is presented which applies especially to programming languages in which statements can be nested such as algol and pl/i the method permits editing of the source language using a general purpose text editor and incremental processing of changes without frequent recompilation of entire routines the essential points of the method are 1 the syntax of the language is restricted insof ar as which constructs may occur on lines 2 an internal data structure called the skeleton is maintained to represent the statement structure 3 the recompilation is partially batched in the sense that recompilation of modified lines does not occur until the last of a set of editing commands has been received and 4 the parsing and compilation are factored into two parts that done on individual lines and that done globally to handle the relationships between the lines cacm december 1972 earley j caizergues p incremental compiler interactive programming language 4.12 4.22 ca721203 jb january 27 1978 1:04 pm
