a hardware architecture for implementing protection rings protection of computations and information is an important aspect of a computer utility in a system which uses segmentation as a memory addressing scheme protection can be achieved in part by associating concentric rings of decreasing access privilege with a computation this paper describes hardware processor mechanisms for implementing these rings of protection the mechanisms for implementing these rings of protection the mechanisms allow cross-ring calls and subsequent returns to occur without trapping to the supervisor automatic hardware validation of references across ring boundaries is also performed thus a call by a user procedure to a protected subsystem including the supervisor is identical to a call to a companion user procedure the mechanisms of passing and referencing arguments are the same in both cases as well cacm march 1972 schroeder m d saltzer j h protection protection rings protection hardware access control hardware access control computer utility time-sharing shared information segmentation virtual memory multics 4.32 6.21 ca720304 jb january 31 1978 2:58 pm
