remote on-line real-time computer diagnosis of the clinical electrocardiogram presented in this paper is a brief report on the hardware software system configuration and function of a system for the remote online real-time digital computer diagnosis of clinical electrocardiograms it seems likely that efforts of this sort will lead to a satisfactory solution to the problem of the automatic diagnosis of electrocardiograms current attempts by the authors to extend the diagnostic capabilities of the present system are particularly concerned with increasing the fidelity of the adaptive matched filters the development of three dimensional pattern analysis the analysis of parallel electrocardiographer-computer diagnostic interaction and a study of the possibility of introducing major tree-like branching decisions early in the diagnostic process cacm january 1965 whipple g h dickson j f horibe h stark l ca650112 jb march 8 1978 2:27 pm
