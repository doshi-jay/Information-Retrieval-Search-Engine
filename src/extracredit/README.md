- We have attempted the query corrector implementation by using the edit distance formula.
- We suggest corrections for terms that are not present in the corpus of CACM
and suggest a word that is within an edit distance of 1 or 2 from the potentially incorrect query term. 
- Please refer to the README.md in the folder `QueryCorrector` for specific compilation details.

- We tried to attempt the KL-divergence model as an extra credit question
but were unsuccessful in retrieving satisfactory results.
- We have submitted the code irrespective of that.
